  <p class="western c1">Form 3C:1 Venue - Motion to Transfer, Improper County</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE</p>

  <p class="western c3">Defendant files this motion to transfer venue and asks the court to transfer this case from {<i>current</i>} County to {<i>proposed</i>} County.</p>

  <p class="western c2">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c3">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">2. Plaintiff sued defendant in {<i>current</i>} County for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">3. This case should be transferred out of {<i>current</i>} County, which is not a proper county for venue, to {<i>proposed</i>} County, a proper county for venue. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Improper County &amp; Convenience,” ch. 3-C, §2, p. 162.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD PARAGRAPH 4 IF SPECIAL APPEARANCE IS PENDING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">4. The relief requested in this motion is subject to the court’s ruling on defendant’s special appearance. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Due Order of Pleadings,” ch. 3-A, §3, p. 147.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c3">5. Defendant specifically denies plaintiff’s venue facts that {<i>deny each venue fact pleaded by plaintiff, e.g., a substantial part of the events giving rise to this suit arose in this county, defendant has its principal office in this county</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Denial of venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(1), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">6. Defendant specifically pleads that this case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County because {<i>plead venue facts supporting transfer to county of proper venue</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Allege specific county,” ch. 3-C, §2.4.2, p. 164.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">7. Defendant attaches affidavits to this motion to establish defendant’s venue facts and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c2">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c2">Improper Venue</p>

  <p class="western c3">8. Venue of this case is improper in {<i>current</i>} County because this county is not a county of proper venue under any of the venue rules. Contrary to plaintiff’s allegations, {<i>current</i>} County is not a county of proper venue under {<i>a mandatory venue provision/a permissive venue provision/the general venue rule/{identify other provision or reason that makes venue improper}</i>}. {<i>Elaborate, identifying statutory provision or other reason that makes venue in this county improper, and stating facts that support the argument.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">Proper Venue</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 9</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. This case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County, which is a proper county under a mandatory venue provision in {<i>specify mandatory provision, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.011</i>} because {<i>specify reason, e.g., this suit involves partition of real property in Lubbock County</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Mandatory Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §4, p. 118.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. This case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County, which is a proper county under a permissive venue provision, because no mandatory venue provision applies. Venue is permissive in {<i>proposed</i>} County under {<i>identify statute, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.031</i>} because {<i>specify reason, e.g., this is a suit for a debt of an estate and the proposed county is the county where the estate is being administered</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Permissive Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §6, p. 122.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. This case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County, which is a proper county under the general venue rule, Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.002(a), because no mandatory venue provision applies. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General Venue Rule,” ch. 2-G, §5, p. 121.</i>} Venue is proper in {<i>proposed</i>} County because it {<i>is/was</i>} the county</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(A) where all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(1). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(B) of defendant’s residence at the time the cause of action accrued. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(2). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(C) of defendant’s principal office in this state. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(3); <i>see In re Missouri Pac. R.R.</i>, 998 S.W.2d 212, 216-17 (Tex. 1999) (FELA case). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(D) where plaintiff resided at the time the cause of action accrued. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(4). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. This case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County because this is the same case filed earlier under cause number {<i>number</i>}, in which plaintiff took a nonsuit after the court granted defendant’s motion to transfer venue. The earlier ruling on venue conclusively fixes venue in {<i>proposed</i>} County. <i>Hyman Farm Serv., Inc. v. Earth Oil &amp; Gas Co.</i>, 920 S.W.2d 452, 456 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1996, no writ); <i>Hendrick Med. Ctr. v. Howell</i>, 690 S.W.2d 42, 44 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1985, orig. proceeding).</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. This case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County because the parties signed a written consent to transfer the case to another county of proper venue. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.063(3); Tex. R. Civ. P. 255. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} Attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} is the signed agreement. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Consent Transfer,” ch. 3-C, §4, p. 172.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTION D IF APPROPRIATE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">D. Transfer for Convenience</p>

  <p class="western c3">10. {<i>Insert allegations from FORM 3C:3.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Venue convenient elsewhere,” ch. 3-C, §2.3.5, p. 163.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">E. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c3">11. Because venue is proper in {<i>proposed</i>} County, the court should transfer this case to {<i>proposed</i>} County.</p>

  <p class="western c2">F. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c3">12. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set {<i>his/her/its</i>} motion to transfer venue for hearing and, after the hearing, grant defendant’s motion and transfer this case to {<i>proposed</i>} County. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Request hearing,” ch. 3-C, §2.2.5, p. 163.</i>}</p>
