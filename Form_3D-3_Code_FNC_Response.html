  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c3">MOTION TO{</span><i class="c4">DISMISS/STAY</i><span class="c3">} FOR FORUM NON CONVENIENS</span></p>

  <p class="western c6">Plaintiff asks the court to deny defendant’s motion to {<i>dismiss/stay</i>} for forum non conveniens. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plaintiff’s response,” ch. 3-D, §3.4, p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c6">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c7">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c6">3. {<i>State facts relevant to the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">4. Plaintiff attaches affidavits to this response to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c7">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 5-14</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">5. Defendant did not file {<i>his/her/its</i>} motion timely. A motion for forum non conveniens based on Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 71.051 must be filed not later than 180 days after the deadline to file a motion to transfer venue. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(d). The deadline for defendant to file the motion to transfer venue in this case was {<i>date</i>}; 180 days from that date was {<i>date</i>}. Defendant filed {<i>his/her/its</i>} motion on {<i>date</i>}, which was {<i>number</i>} days after the deadline to file a motion to transfer venue. Under Section 71.051(d), defendant waived the right to contest the forum for this lawsuit. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Waiver,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(9), p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">6. Defendant did not give proper notice of the hearing on {<i>his/her/its</i>} motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens because {<i>he/she/it</i>} did not {<i>set the hearing at least 30 days before trial/give 21 days’ notice of the hearing</i>}. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(d). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Improper notice of hearing,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(7), p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">7. This suit involves a plaintiff who is a legal resident of Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plaintiff is Texas resident,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(1), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">8. This suit involves {<i>number</i>} plaintiffs, some of whom are legal residents of Texas and others who are not. {<i>Identify which plaintiffs are legal residents of Texas and which are not.</i>} When a lawsuit involves both plaintiffs who are legal residents of this state and plaintiffs who are not, the court cannot stay or dismiss the action under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 71.051(b) if the plaintiffs who are legal residents of Texas are properly joined in the action and the action arose out of a single occurrence. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plaintiff is Texas resident,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(1), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. The Texas plaintiffs are properly joined in this lawsuit. {<i>Demonstrate why joinder of Texas plaintiffs is proper.</i>} The Texas plaintiffs were not joined solely for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining jurisdiction in Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. This action arose out of a single occurrence. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">9. Defendant did not identify an alternate forum that is available to decide plaintiff’s cause of action. Under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 71.051(b)(1), defendant must identify a specific forum in which this suit may be tried. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Alternate forum,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(2), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">10. Texas is the proper forum for plaintiff’s suit because</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE STATEMENT</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">(A) the courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} do not offer an adequate remedy for {<i>plaintiff</i>}’s cause of action. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(2). {<i>Show that alternate forum would not allow plaintiff’s claim or provide similar relief.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">(B) maintaining this suit in Texas would not work a substantial injustice on defendant. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(3). {<i>Elaborate by refuting reasons asserted by defendant.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">(C) the courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} cannot exercise jurisdiction over all defendants properly joined to plaintiff’s claim. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(4). {<i>Identify properly joined defendants and show that alternate forum cannot exercise jurisdiction over one or more of them.</i>} {<i>Defendant has not/Not all of the defendants have</i>} filed a {<i>identify document, e.g., stipulation</i>} agreeing to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case by {<i>alternate forum</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">11. The private interests of the litigants will be better served in Texas than in {<i>alternate forum</i>} for the following reasons:</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT FACTORS BELOW</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. Access to proof will be easier in Texas than in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. Compulsory process for the attendance of unwilling witnesses is available in Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. The cost of obtaining the presence of willing witnesses will be lower in Texas than in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">d. A view of the premises is possible in Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">e. The enforcement of the judgment is easier in Texas than in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">12. The public interests will be better served in Texas as the proper forum for the following reasons:</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT FACTORS BELOW</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. The administrative burden on the Texas court is less than on the {<i>alternate forum</i>} court because {<i>identify reasons, e.g., congested docket</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. Texas has an interest in adjudicating this case, and {<i>alternate forum</i>} does not. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. Texas law will control the disposition of this case. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">13. Texas is the proper forum for plaintiff’s suit because an act or omission that resulted in plaintiff’s claim for {<i>injury/death</i>} occurred in Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(5). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Texas injury,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(5)(b), p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">14. Texas is the proper forum for plaintiff’s suit, and the court’s {<i>dismissal/stay</i>} of plaintiff’s cause of action based on forum non conveniens would result in unreasonable duplication or proliferation of litigation. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(6). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Duplication or proliferation,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(6), p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">D. Alternative Argument</p>

  <p class="western c6">15. In the event this court grants defendant’s motion, the court may either sign an order that dismisses all or part of plaintiff’s lawsuit or sign an order that merely stays the lawsuit. <i>See</i> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b). Plaintiff asks the court to stay, not dismiss, this suit because {<i>state reasons court should stay instead of dismiss</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Dismissal or stay under Code,” ch. 3-D, §6.1, p. 180.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">16. In the event this court grants defendant’s motion, the court may set terms and conditions for staying or dismissing a claim or action in the interest of justice, giving due regard to the rights of the parties to the claim or action. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(c). Plaintiff asks the court to sign an order that imposes the following conditions: {<i>list conditions for dismissal or stay</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Dismissal or stay under Code,” ch. 3-D, §6.1, p. 180.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">E. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c6">17. Because Texas is the proper forum for plaintiff’s suit, the court should deny defendant’s motion for forum non conveniens.</p>

  <p class="western c7">F. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c6">18. For these reasons, plaintiff asks the court to deny defendant’s motion for forum non conveniens; or, in the alternative, plaintiff asks the court to stay this suit and impose the following conditions: {<i>list conditions</i>}.</p>
