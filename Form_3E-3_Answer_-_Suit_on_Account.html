  <p class="western c3">JURISDICTION, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS, &amp; REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE</p>

  <p class="western c4">Defendant, {<i>name</i>}, files this original answer to plaintiff {<i>name</i>}’s original petition.</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. General Denial</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Defendant generally denies the allegations in plaintiff’s original petition. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General Denial,” ch. 3-E, §3, p. 182.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTIONS B-G AS APPROPRIATE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Plea to the Jurisdiction</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Defendant asks the court to dismiss plaintiff’s suit because of lack of jurisdiction. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See FORM 3F:1;</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plea to the Jurisdiction-Challenging the Court,” ch. 3-F, p. 191.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Verified Pleas</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 3-12</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because not each and every item of the account made the basis of plaintiff’s suit is just or true. {<i>List each item that is not just or true and explain why it is not just or true.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Verified pleas in TRCP 93,” ch. 3-E, §4.1.10, p. 184.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because the claim is not yet due. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because plaintiff has not credited defendant’s account with all just and lawful offsets, payments, and other credits. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because the amount of the account plaintiff claims is due is incorrect. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because plaintiff charged defendant prices for the {<i>goods/services/goods and services</i>} that are not in accordance with the parties’ agreement and are unreasonable. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because no systematic record was kept of amounts due on the account. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because defendant has never had an open account with plaintiff, a written or oral contract with plaintiff for goods or services, or any business dealings with plaintiff on which an account could be founded. {<i>Elaborate, e.g., defendant had only one business transaction with plaintiff, and defendant paid plaintiff in full at the time of that transaction.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Defendant denies the account on which plaintiff files suit because {<i>state any other reason that defendant is not liable to plaintiff as alleged in plaintiff’s suit</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Jury Demand</p>

  <p class="western c4">14. Defendant demands a jury trial and tenders the appropriate fee with this answer. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Request for Jury Trial,” ch. 5-B, p. 241.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">F. Special Exceptions</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 15-17</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">15. Defendant specially excepts to plaintiff’s original petition, paragraph {<i>number</i>} regarding damages, and asks the court to require plaintiff to specify the maximum amount of damages that plaintiff claims. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Unliquidated damages,” ch. 3-G, §2.2.5, p. 198. For the order on special exceptions, see FORM 3G:2.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">16. Defendant specially excepts to plaintiff’s petition because the claims are not properly brought as a suit on a sworn account. This is a suit for {<i>describe cause of action, e.g., breach of a lease</i>}. {<i>Elaborate, e.g., a suit involving a breach of a lease agreement is not a valid claim on a sworn account.</i>} {<i>See Murphy v. Cintas Corp., 923 S.W.2d 663, 665 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1996, writ denied).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">17. {<i>For other special exceptions, see FORM 3G:1.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">G. Request for Disclosure</p>

  <p class="western c4">18. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, defendant requests that plaintiff disclose, within 30 days of the service of this request, the information or material described in Rule 194.2. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Content of request,” ch. 6-D, §3.2, p. 392.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">H. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">19. For these reasons, defendant asks for the following relief: a court order requiring plaintiff to replead; if plaintiff refuses to replead, a court order striking plaintiff’s original petition and dismissing plaintiff’s suit; and, if the case is tried on the merits, a judgment that plaintiff take nothing, that assesses costs against plaintiff, and that awards defendant all other relief to which defendant is entitled. {<i>If defendant asserts claims for affirmative relief, include a request for rendition of judgment on those claims. See FORM 2B:1.</i>}</p>
