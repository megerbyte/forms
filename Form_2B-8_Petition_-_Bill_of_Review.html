  <p class="western c3">C. Jurisdiction</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. This bill of review is filed in the same court that rendered the judgment challenged by this bill of review, after the deadline for filing a motion for new trial, when a restricted appeal under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 30 is not available, and within the residual four-year statute of limitations. {<i>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §16.051.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. On {<i>date</i>}, defendant (as plaintiff in the earlier suit) sued plaintiff (as defendant in the earlier suit) in this court in cause number {<i>number</i>}, {<i>style of case</i>}, for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Pleading a Cause of Action,” ch. 2-B, §6, p. 78.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. On {<i>date</i>}, a {<i>judgment/default judgment</i>} was rendered against plaintiff. A copy of the judgment is attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} and incorporated by reference. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Bill of review,” ch. 7-A, §7.1.3, p. 470.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c6">E. {</span><i class="c7">No Service/No Notice/Fraud/Accident/Wrongful Act/Official Mistake</i><span class="c6">}</span></p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 7</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. Plaintiff was not served with citation and a copy of the petition. Specifically, {<i>state facts proving lack of service of process</i>}. In support, the affidavit of {<i>name of affiant</i>} is attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} and incorporated by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. Plaintiff did not receive notice of the {<i>hearing/trial</i>} held on {<i>date</i>}, after which the court rendered a default judgment against plaintiff. Specifically, {<i>state facts proving lack of service of notice</i>}. In support, the affidavit of {<i>name of affiant</i>} is attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} and incorporated by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. The judgment in cause number {<i>number</i>} was rendered against plaintiff as the result of {<i>fraud/an accident/a wrongful act</i>} on the part of defendant. Specifically, {<i>identify specific act, e.g., fraudulent failure to serve party with service, failure to notify party of trial setting, and state how it prevented plaintiff from asserting its meritorious defense. See Lambert v. Coachmen Indus., Inc., 761 S.W.2d 82, 87 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1988, writ denied)</i>}. In support, the affidavit of {<i>name of affiant</i>} is attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} and incorporated by reference.</p>

See Baker v. Goldsmith, 582 S.W.2d 404, 407 (Tex. 1979); K.B. Video &amp; Elecs., Inc. v. Naylor, 847 S.W.2d 401, 407 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1993, writ denied)</i>}. In support, the affidavit of {<i>name of affiant</i>} is attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} and incorporated by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. Plaintiff’s inability to prevent the entry of the {<i>judgment/default judgment</i>} was not the result of any fault or negligence of plaintiff. {<i>Explain in detail plaintiff’s diligence in availing itself of all legal remedies, e.g., party exercised due diligence but did not learn of the judgment until the deadline for appeal and motion for new trial had passed.</i>} In support, the affidavit of {<i>name of affiant</i>} is attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} and incorporated by reference.</p>
