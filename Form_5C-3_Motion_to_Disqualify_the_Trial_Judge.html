  <p class="western c5">4. Under Texas Constitution article 5, section 11, a judge is disqualified from sitting in judgment when</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE GROUND</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(A) the judge served as an attorney in the matter in controversy. Tex. Const. art. 5, §11. A judge is prohibited by the Texas Constitution from sitting in any case where {<i>he/she</i>} has been counsel. Tex. Const. art. 5, §11; <i>Slaven v. Wheeler</i>, 58 Tex. 23, 26 (1882); <i>Williams v. Kirven</i>, 532 S.W.2d 159, 161 (Tex. App.—Austin 1976, writ ref’d n.r.e.); <i>cf.</i> <i>Greer v. State</i>, 999 S.W.2d 484, 487-88 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. ref’d) (criminal case). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Judge served as a lawyer,” ch. 13-J, §3.1, p. 104.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(B) the case is one in which the judge “may be interested.” Tex. Const. art. 5, §11; <i>Cameron v. Greenhill</i>, 582 S.W.2d 775, 776 (Tex. 1979). The interest must be a direct pecuniary or personal interest in the result of the case. <i>Cameron</i>, 582 S.W.2d at 776. Once an interest is established, the judge is disqualified no matter how slight the interest. <i>Id.</i> {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Disqualifying interests,” ch. 13-J, §3.2, p. 105.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(C) the judge is related to a party in the suit within the third degree of affinity or consanguinity. <i>See</i> Tex. Const. art. 5, §11. The Constitution does not identify the degree of relationship that will result in disqualification; it merely states a judge shall not sit in a case where related to a party “within such a degree as may be prescribed by law.” <i>Id.</i> Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b(1)(c) defines the prohibited degrees of relationship for disqualification. {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Related to party,” ch. 13-J, §3.3, p. 106.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(B) an attorney, who previously practiced law with the judge, served as an attorney in the matter in controversy during the association. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(1)(a); <i>In re O’Connor</i>, 92 S.W.3d 446, 449 (Tex. 2002). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Association with lawyer,” ch. 13-J, §3.4.1(1), p. 108.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(C) the judge knows that, individually or as a fiduciary, {<i>he/she</i>} has an interest in the subject matter in controversy. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(1)(b). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Interest in suit,” ch. 13-J, §3.4.1(2), p. 108.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(D) the judge is related by affinity or consanguinity to one of the parties in the lawsuit within the third degree. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(1)(c). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Related to party,” ch. 13-J, §3.4.1(3), p. 108.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. {<i>State specific facts that show the judge is disqualified under the Texas Constitution or Rule 18b(1).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">D. Notice to Other Parties</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. A copy of this motion is served on the other parties on the same day this motion is filed. {<i>Party</i>} expects this motion to disqualify to be presented to Judge {<i>name</i>} three days after it is filed, unless Judge {<i>name</i>} orders otherwise.
