  <p class="western c2">{<i>PARTY</i>}’S RESPONSE TO</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c3">{</span><i class="c4">ADVERSE PARTY</i><span class="c3">}’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY OPPOSING COUNSEL</span></p>

  <p class="western c5">{<i>Party</i>} asks the court to deny {<i>adverse party</i>}’s motion to disqualify.</p>

  <p class="western c6">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c5">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c5">3. On {<i>date</i>}, {<i>adverse party</i>} filed a motion to disqualify {<i>name of attorney or firm</i>} from further participation in this case.</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. {<i>State other facts relevant to the response.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. {<i>Party</i>} attaches affidavits to this response to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c6">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 6</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. A lawyer or law firm should not be disqualified from representing a party in a matter adverse to a former client unless the matter is “substantially related” to the earlier representation. Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Conduct 1.09; <i>In re Epic Holdings, Inc.</i>, 985 S.W.2d 41, 43 (Tex. 1998); <i>Texaco, Inc. v. Garcia</i>, 891 S.W.2d 255, 256 (Tex. 1995). The substantial relationship test requires proof that the facts of the earlier representation are so related to the facts in the pending litigation that a genuine threat exists that confidences revealed to former counsel will be divulged to a present adversary. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Syntek Fin. Corp.</i>, 881 S.W.2d 319, 320-21 (Tex. 1994). {<i>See</i> <i class="c7">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Lawyer represented other party,” ch. 1-H, §8.2.2, p. 45.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. If a lawyer becomes a witness, the lawyer is disqualified to act as a lawyer in the case. <i>Mauze v. Curry</i>, 861 S.W.2d 869, 870 (Tex. 1993). If a lawyer’s testimony may be necessary to establish an essential fact on his client’s behalf, the court should disqualify the lawyer. <i>See In re Bahn</i>, 13 S.W.3d 865, 874 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2000, orig. proceeding); <i>Warrilow v. Norrell</i>, 791 S.W.2d 515, 523 n.10 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1989, writ denied). If the lawyer’s role as both an advocate and a witness will cause the opposing party actual prejudice, the court should disqualify the lawyer. <i>In re Sanders</i>, 153 S.W.3d 54, 57 (Tex. 2004); <i>Ayres v. Canales</i>, 790 S.W.2d 554, 558 (Tex. 1990). A lawyer who testifies as a fact witness may, however, continue representation if the attorney’s withdrawal would work a substantial hardship on the client because of the distinctive value of the lawyer as counsel in the particular case. <i>Ayres</i>, 790 S.W.2d at 557; <i>Warrilow</i>, 791 S.W.2d at 520. {<i>See</i> <i class="c7">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Lawyer as witness,” ch. 1-H, §8.2.5, p. 46.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 7-11</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. {<i>Name</i>}, a {<i>lawyer/partner in the firm/associate in the firm</i>} representing {<i>party</i>} did not personally represent {<i>adverse party</i>} in a matter factually related to this proceeding. {<i>State facts of earlier representation and identify facts that negate a substantial relationship between the earlier matter and the pending litigation, e.g., dissimilar defenses, dissimilar scientific issues, dissimilar liability issues, dissimilar strategies.</i>} Therefore, there is no threat that {<i>adverse party</i>}’s former confidences will be divulged to {<i>party</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. {<i>Name of firm representing party</i>} has screening procedures to ensure that {<i>name</i>}, an employee of {<i>name of firm representing party</i>}, has no contact with this case. {<i>Describe the procedures that prevent employee’s contact with the case.</i>} Further, {<i>name of employee</i>} has not divulged any information relating to the case to any employees of {<i>name of firm representing party</i>}. The court, therefore, should not disqualify {<i>name of firm representing party</i>} from participation in this case.</p>

  <p class="western c5">9. Counsel for {<i>party</i>} has no personal knowledge of essential facts in this case and will not be called as a witness. The court, therefore, should not disqualify {<i>party</i>}’s counsel from further participation in this case.</p>

  <p class="western c5">10. Although counsel for {<i>party</i>} {<i>has testified/will testify</i>} about fact issues, counsel’s role as both an advocate and a witness {<i>has not caused/will not cause</i>} {<i>adverse party</i>} actual prejudice. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">11. Although counsel for {<i>party</i>} {<i>has testified/will testify</i>} about fact issues, the withdrawal of {<i>party</i>}’s attorney would work a substantial hardship on {<i>party</i>}. {<i>Specify expertise of counsel and demonstrate hardship.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c5">12. {<i>Briefly summarize the response.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c5">13. For these reasons, {<i>party</i>} asks the court to deny {<i>adverse party</i>}’s motion to disqualify, and allow counsel to continue to participate in this case.</p>
