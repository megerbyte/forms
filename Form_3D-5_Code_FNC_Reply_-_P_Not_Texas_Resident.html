  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S REPLY TO PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c3">THE MOTION TO {</span><i class="c4">DISMISS/STAY</i><span class="c3">} FOR FORUM NON CONVENIENS</span></p>

  <p class="western c6">Defendant asks the court to {<i>dismiss/stay</i>} this suit on grounds of forum non conveniens, as authorized by Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 71.051. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Defendant’s reply,” ch. 3-D, §3.5, p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c6">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c7">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c6">3. {<i>State facts relevant to the reply.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">4. Defendant attaches affidavits to this reply to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c7">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 5-15</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">5. Plaintiff claims {<i>he/she</i>} is a legal resident of Texas. This is not correct. {<i>Elaborate and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">6. Plaintiff claims {<i>he/she</i>} is a legal resident of Texas. Even though plaintiff presently lives in Texas, plaintiff is not a legal resident of Texas. The Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 71.051(h)(1) defines a “legal resident” as an individual who intends a specified political subdivision to be his or her permanent residence and who intends to return to that political subdivision despite temporary residence elsewhere or temporary absences. Plaintiff is not a legal resident because {<i>he/she</i>} moved to Texas for the sole purpose of avoiding the provisions of Section 71.051. Under Section 71.051(h)(1), an individual who adopts a residence, in bad faith, for purposes of avoiding the application of forum non conveniens is not a legal resident. {<i>Elaborate and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Legal resident,” ch. 3-D, §3.1.2, p. 175.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">7. Plaintiff claims that all of the plaintiffs in this suit who are legal residents of Texas are properly joined parties. This is not correct. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>}, a Texas plaintiff, was joined solely for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining jurisdiction in Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). The claims of plaintiff {<i>name</i>} would be more properly heard in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. <i>Id.</i> {<i>Demonstrate by preponderance of the evidence why joinder of Texas plaintiffs was improper and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plaintiff is Texas resident,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(1), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">8. Plaintiff alleges that the claims on which the Texas and nonresident plaintiffs’ suits are based arose from a single occurrence. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). This is not correct. The occurrence which gave rise to the action by plaintiff {<i>name</i>}, a Texas plaintiff, is not the same occurrence that gave rise to the actions by the nonresident plaintiffs. {<i>Demonstrate how the claims of resident and nonresident plaintiffs did not arise out of a single occurrence.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plaintiff is Texas resident,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(1), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">9. Plaintiff alleges the courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} do not offer an adequate remedy for plaintiff’s cause of action because {<i>repeat plaintiff’s allegations</i>}. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(2). This is not correct. {<i>Refute plaintiff’s allegations and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Alternate forum,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(2), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">10. Plaintiff alleges the courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} cannot exercise jurisdiction over all the defendants properly joined in plaintiff’s suit. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(4). This is not correct. {<i>Identify properly joined defendants and show that alternate forum can exercise jurisdiction over each and refer to evidence attached to the reply. If necessary, file a stipulation agreeing to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by that forum.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No jurisdiction,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(4), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">11. Plaintiff alleges that maintaining this suit in Texas will not work a substantial injustice on defendant because {<i>repeat plaintiff’s allegations</i>}. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(3). This is not correct. {<i>Refute plaintiff’s allegations and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No substantial injustice,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(3), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">12. Plaintiff alleges the private interests of the litigants will be better served in Texas than in {<i>alternate forum</i>} because {<i>repeat plaintiff’s private-interest arguments</i>}. This is not correct. {<i>Refute each of plaintiff’s arguments.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Balance of interests,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(5), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">13. Plaintiff alleges the public interests will be better served in Texas than in {<i>alternate forum</i>} because {<i>repeat plaintiff’s public-interest arguments</i>}. This is not correct. {<i>Refute each of plaintiff’s arguments.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Balance of interests,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(5), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">14. Plaintiff alleges the act or omission that resulted in {<i>his/her</i>} claim for {<i>injury/death</i>} occurred in Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(5). This is not correct. {<i>Elaborate and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Texas injury,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(5)(b), p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">15. Plaintiff alleges this court’s {<i>dismissal/stay</i>} of plaintiff’s cause of action based on forum non conveniens will result in unreasonable duplication and proliferation of litigation. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(6). This is not correct. {<i>Refute plaintiff’s allegations and refer to evidence attached to the reply.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Duplication or proliferation,” ch. 3-D, §3.4.2(6), p. 178.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">D. Alternative Argument</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 16-18</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">16. Plaintiff made the alternative argument that if the court grants defendant’s motion, the court should merely stay the lawsuit, not dismiss it. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). The effect of a dismissal is not much different than a stay. Under Section 71.051(e), the court has continuing jurisdiction over the case, even after granting a dismissal. Defendant asks the court to dismiss the suit because {<i>state reasons court should dismiss instead of stay</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Dismissal or stay under Code,” ch. 3-D, §6.1, p. 180.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">17. Plaintiff made the alternative argument that if the court grants defendant’s motion, the court should merely stay the lawsuit, not dismiss it. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). However, defendant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff {<i>name</i>} was joined solely for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining jurisdiction in Texas and that the claims of plaintiff {<i>name</i>} would be more properly heard in a forum outside of Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). Thus, this court cannot stay the lawsuit, but instead must dismiss it. <i>Id.</i></p>

  <p class="western c6">18. Plaintiff made the alternative argument that if the court grants defendant’s motion, the court should set terms and conditions for the order staying or dismissing the lawsuit. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(c). Plaintiff listed the terms and conditions {<i>he/she</i>} asked the court to impose. The court should deny plaintiff’s request because {<i>state why terms and conditions are not appropriate</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Dismissal or stay under Code,” ch. 3-D, §6.1, p. 180.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">E. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c6">19. The court should grant defendant’s motion to {<i>dismiss/stay</i>} for forum non conveniens because plaintiff’s suit can be properly heard in {<i>alternate forum</i>}, defendant would be prejudiced if forced to defend in Texas, and the private and public interests would be better served if plaintiff’s case were heard in {<i>alternate forum</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c7">F. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c6">20. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set {<i>his/her/its</i>} motion for forum non conveniens for hearing at least 30 days before trial, provide the parties 21 days’ notice of the hearing, and, after the hearing, grant defendant’s motion and sign an order {<i>dismissing/staying</i>} plaintiff’s suit.</p>
