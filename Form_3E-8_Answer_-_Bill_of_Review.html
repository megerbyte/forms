  <p class="western c1">Form 3E:8 Answer - Bill of Review</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S ORIGINAL ANSWER, PLEA TO THE</p>

  <p class="western c3">JURISDICTION, SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS, &amp; REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE</p>

  <p class="western c4">Defendant, {<i>name</i>}, files this original answer to plaintiff {<i>name</i>}’s original petition for bill of review.</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. General Denial</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Defendant generally denies the allegations in plaintiff’s original petition. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General Denial,” ch. 3-E, §3, p. 182.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTIONS B-G AS APPROPRIATE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Plea to the Jurisdiction</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Defendant asks the court to dismiss plaintiff’s suit because of lack of jurisdiction. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See FORM 3F:1;</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plea to the Jurisdiction-Challenging the Court,” ch. 3-F, p. 191.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Verified Pleas</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 3-4</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. Plaintiff is not entitled to challenge the judgment in cause number {<i>number</i>} by bill of review because {<i>state why, e.g., plaintiff was not a party to the earlier judgment</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. {<i>For other verified pleas, see FORM 3E:9;</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Verified Pleas,” ch. 3-E, §4, p. 182.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Other Defenses</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 5-8</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. The plaintiff permitted the judgment in this case to become final by failing to appeal it and thus is not entitled to bill-of-review relief. {<i>See French v. Brown, 424 S.W.2d 893, 895 (Tex. 1967).</i>} Relief by bill of review is available only if a party has exercised due diligence in pursuing all available legal remedies against a former judgment. {<i>Wembley Inv. Co. v. Herrera, 11 S.W.3d 924, 927 (Tex. 1999).</i>} When a party ignores available remedies, relief by equitable bill of review is not available. {<i>Id.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. The plaintiff prosecuted an appeal of this judgment, and that appeal affirmed the judgment. For the appeal, see {<i>case name</i>}, cause number {<i>number</i>}, {<i>date</i>}. A bill of review cannot be used as an additional remedy by a litigant who has made a timely but unsuccessful appeal. {<i>Rizk v. Mayad, 603 S.W.2d 773, 776 (Tex. 1980).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Defendant is not liable to plaintiff because plaintiff’s bill of review is barred by the four-year statute of limitations in Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 16.051. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>Caldwell v. Barnes, 975 S.W.2d 535, 538 (Tex. 1998).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. {<i>For other affirmative defenses, see FORM 3E:10;</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Affirmative Defenses,” ch. 3-E, §5, p. 184.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Attorney Fees</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 9</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. Defendant is entitled to recover reasonable and necessary attorney fees because {<i>he/she/it</i>} was entitled to attorney fees on the underlying claim that plaintiff is challenging by the bill of review. The underlying claim was for {<i>identify claim</i>}, which entitles defendant to attorney fees under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 38.001. Defendant retained counsel, who presented defendant’s claim to {<i>plaintiff/ plaintiff’s duly authorized agent</i>}. Plaintiff did not tender the amount owed within 30 days of the date the claim was presented. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s COA</i>, <i>“Attorney Fees Under CPRC Ch. 38,” ch. 49-B, p. 1175.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. Defendant is entitled to recover reasonable and necessary attorney fees under the provisions of the written contract, as set out in paragraph {<i>number</i>}. By that contract, defendant is entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party on this bill of review. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s COA</i><i>, “Attorney Fees Under Written Contract,” ch. 49-C, p. 1185.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">F. Special Exceptions</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Defendant specially excepts to plaintiff’s original petition, paragraph {<i>number</i>} regarding damages, and asks the court to require plaintiff to specify the maximum amount of damages that plaintiff claims. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Unliquidated damages,” ch. 3-G, §2.2.5, p. 198. For the order on special exceptions, see FORM 3G:2.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. {<i>For other special exceptions, see FORM 3G:1.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">G. Request for Disclosure</p>

  <p class="western c4">12. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, defendant requests that plaintiff disclose, within 30 days of the service of this request, the information or material described in Rule 194.2. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Content of request,” ch. 6-D, §3.2, p. 392.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">H. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">13. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to dismiss this suit with prejudice or render judgment that plaintiff take nothing and award all other relief to which defendant is entitled.</p>
