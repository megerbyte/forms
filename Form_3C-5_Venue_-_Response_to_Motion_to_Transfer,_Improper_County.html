  <p class="western c1">Form 3C:5 Venue - Response to Motion to Transfer, Improper County</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO</p>

  <p class="western c3">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE</p>

  <p class="western c4">Plaintiff files this response to defendant’s motion to transfer venue and asks the court to deny defendant’s motion and retain the case on the court’s docket in {<i>current</i>} County.</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Plaintiff sued defendant in {<i>current</i>} County for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. Plaintiff pleaded venue facts in {<i>his/her/its</i>} petition that support venue in {<i>current</i>} County. {<i>Identify venue facts in petition that support venue in this county.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 4-7</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. In defendant’s motion to transfer, defendant did not specifically deny any of plaintiff’s venue facts. Instead of a specific denial, defendant made a global denial of all the venue facts by stating “{<i>quote defendant’s denial</i>}.” <i>See Bleeker v. Villarreal</i>, 941 S.W.2d 163, 176 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1996, writ dism’d) (denying “the fact that venue is proper” is not a specific denial); <i>Maranatha Temple, Inc. v. Enterprise Prods. Co.</i>, 833 S.W.2d 736, 740 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied) (same). A global denial does not satisfy the requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 87(3)(a). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Denial of venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(1), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. In defendant’s motion to transfer venue, defendant specifically denied that {<i>identify plaintiff’s venue facts that defendant specifically denied, e.g., a substantial part of the events giving rise to this suit arose in this county, defendant has its principal office in this county</i>}. Contrary to defendant’s specific denial of venue facts, {<i>state venue facts as pleaded in petition</i>}. {<i>Elaborate, stating venue facts that support venue in current county.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Proof of denied venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.7.1, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. Plaintiff amended {<i>his/her/its</i>} original petition to {<i>add/subtract</i>} the following {<i>facts/claims</i>}: {<i>identify venue facts or claims added or subtracted</i>}. Plaintiff filed the amended petition at least seven days before the hearing on the motion to transfer. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} The amended petition supports venue in this county because {<i>explain</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Amend petition,” ch. 3-C, §2.8.1, p. 167.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Plaintiff specifically denies defendant’s venue facts that {<i>list each venue fact pleaded in defendant’s motion to transfer</i>}. Instead, {<i>state venue facts</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Deny defendant’s venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.6, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. Plaintiff attaches affidavits to this response and incorporates them by reference. By these affidavits, plaintiff makes a prima facie case of {<i>his/her/its</i>} venue facts. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Prima facie proof,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(2), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 9-14</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">Waiver</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. Defendant waived {<i>his/her/its</i>} venue challenge because {<i>he/she/it</i>} did not specifically deny any of plaintiff’s venue facts. Because plaintiff’s venue facts were properly pleaded and are unchallenged, they must be taken as true. Tex. R. Civ. P. 87(3)(a); <i>Sanes v. Clark</i>, 25 S.W.3d 800, 803 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000, pet. denied). The plaintiff’s venue facts that establish proper venue in this county are {<i>state plaintiff’s venue facts that establish proper venue</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Denial of venue facts,” §2.11.4(1), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Defendant waived {<i>his/her/its</i>} venue challenge because {<i>he/she/it</i>} filed the motion after the deadline required by both Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 86(1) and Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.063. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Allege waiver,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.7, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">Proper Venue</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. Venue is proper in this county because {<i>current</i>} County is a county of {<i>mandatory/permissive</i>} venue.</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD ONE OF THE FOLLOWING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(A) A suit must be filed in the county of mandatory venue. In this case, plaintiff filed this suit in this county as required by a mandatory provision in {<i>identify statute prescribing mandatory venue, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.011</i>}. {<i>Elaborate</i>, <i>stating facts that comply with mandatory venue provision.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Mandatory Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §4, p. 118.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(B) When no mandatory venue applies, a suit may be filed in any county of permissive venue. In this case, plaintiff filed this suit in this county under a permissive provision in {<i>identify statute providing permissive venue, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.031</i>}. {<i>Elaborate</i>, <i>stating facts that comply with permissive venue provision.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Permissive Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §6, p. 122.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">12. Venue is proper in this county because no mandatory venue provision applies and {<i>current</i>} County is a county of a proper venue under the general venue rule, as provided in Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.002(a). When no mandatory venue applies, a suit may be filed in any county allowed under the general venue rule. In this case, plaintiff filed this suit in this county under {<i>identify specific subsection providing general venue, e.g., section 15.002(a)(1)</i>}. That provision permits venue in this county because {<i>state why, e.g., the automobile accident occurred in this county</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General Venue Rule,” ch. 2-G, §5, p. 121; “Venue proper under general rule,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.1, p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">13. Plaintiff’s choice of venue complies with the requirements of Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.005 because this suit involves multiple defendants. Venue is proper against defendant {<i>name of defendant as to whom venue is proper</i>} because {<i>state venue facts showing venue is proper against that defendant, e.g., defendant is a corporation with its principal office in this county</i>}. Venue is therefore proper against {<i>names of additional defendants</i>} because all of plaintiff’s claims against {<i>names of additional defendants</i>} arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences. {<i>Explain how claims arise out of same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Multiple defendants,” ch. 2-G, §7.3, p. 123.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">14. This case should not be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County because that county is not, as defendant alleges,</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(A) a county of mandatory venue under {<i>specify mandatory provision, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.011</i>}. {<i>State why the mandatory venue provision does not apply.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(B) a proper county under a permissive venue provision. Venue is not permissive in {<i>proposed</i>} County under {<i>identify statute cited by defendant, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.031</i>} because {<i>specify reason, e.g., this is a suit for a debt of an estate and the proposed county is not the county where the estate is being administered</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">(C) a proper county under the general venue rule, Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.002(a). {<i>State why proposed county is not a proper county under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTIONS D-E IF APPLICABLE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Transfer for Convenience</p>

  <p class="western c4">15. {<i>Insert responses from FORM 3C:7.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Venue not convenient elsewhere,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.5, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Need for Continuance</p>

  <p class="western c4">16. Plaintiff asks for an opportunity to conduct discovery and collect affidavits to justify {<i>his/her/its</i>} opposition to defendant’s motion to transfer. As part of this response, plaintiff attaches an affidavit as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>}, in compliance with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 252, stating that plaintiff cannot present by affidavits facts essential to justify {<i>his/her/its</i>} opposition to the motion to transfer without additional time to conduct discovery and seek additional affidavits. <i>See Montalvo v. Fourth Ct. of Appeals</i>, 917 S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex. 1995); <i>cf.</i> <i>City of La Grange v. McBee</i>, 923 S.W.2d 89, 90-91 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, writ denied) (motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 257). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Continuance,” ch. 3-C, §2.10.3, p. 167.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">17. Plaintiff needs additional time to {<i>conduct discovery/secure affidavits</i>} on the venue issues. Specifically, plaintiff intends to {<i>send interrogatories to/send requests for admissions to/take the deposition of/get an affidavit from</i>} {<i>defendant/{name of other person}</i>} to establish that {<i>identify type of information sought</i>}. This information will be material to the issue of establishing proper venue because {<i>explain</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Description of necessary evidence,” ch. 5-D, §8.1, p. 256.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">18. Plaintiff was unable to secure this {<i>testimony/evidence</i>} earlier even though {<i>he/she/it</i>} diligently used the discovery process. {<i>Summarize discovery attempts demonstrating diligence. If known, state why discovery attempts did not secure evidence.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Diligence,” ch. 5-D, §8.3, p. 257.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">19. {<i>Add appropriate paragraphs 14-19 from FORM 5D:1.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">F. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c4">20. Because plaintiff properly pleaded and proved venue is proper in {<i>current</i>} County, this suit must be maintained in this county. <i>See Wilson v. Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Dep’t</i>, 886 S.W.2d 259, 261 (Tex. 1994).</p>

  <p class="western c3">G. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">21. For these reasons, plaintiff asks the court to deny defendant’s motion to transfer venue and retain this case on the court’s docket in {<i>current</i>} County {<i>add if applicable: or, in the alternative, grant plaintiff’s request for a continuance to conduct additional discovery and collect affidavits</i>}.</p>
