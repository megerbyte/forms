  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DECLARE PLAINTIFF</p>

  <p class="western c3">A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT &amp; REQUEST FOR SECURITY</p>

  <p class="western c4">Defendant asks the court to declare plaintiff a vexatious litigant and requests that the court stay the proceedings and order plaintiff to provide security, under the authority of Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 11.051.</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. Defendant filed this motion within 90 days of filing {<i>his/her/its</i>} {<i>original answer/special appearance</i>}, as required by Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 11.051.</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. {<i>State other facts relevant to the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. Defendant attaches affidavits to this motion to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. There is no reasonable probability that plaintiff will prevail on {<i>his/her/its</i>} cause of action against defendant because {<i>state specific reasons</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 7-9</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. The court should grant defendant’s motion because plaintiff has {<i>commenced/prosecuted/maintained</i>} at least five lawsuits (excluding filings in small claims court) in the seven-year period immediately preceding the date of this motion. Of those cases,</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE STATEMENT</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(A) {<i>number</i>} were finally determined adverse to plaintiff. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §11.054(1)(A). {<i>Identify the cause number, style, court, county, and date of filing for each case.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(B) {<i>number</i>} remained pending for at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §11.054(1)(B). {<i>Identify the cause number, style, court, county, and date of filing for each case.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(C) {<i>number</i>} were determined by {<i>a trial/an appeals</i>} court to be {<i>frivolous/groundless</i>} under {<i>state laws/federal laws/the rules of procedure</i>}.

  <p class="western c4">8. The court should grant defendant’s motion because another lawsuit between the parties was finally determined against plaintiff, and plaintiff {<i>has repeatedly relitigated/is attempting to relitigate</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE STATEMENT</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(A) the validity of the final judgment against the same defendant. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §11.054(2)(A). {<i>Identify the cause number, style, court, county, and date of filing for the earlier case.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(B) the {<i>cause of action/claim/controversy/issues of fact/issues of law</i>} against the same defendant. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §11.054(2)(B). {<i>Identify the cause number, style, court, county, and date of filing for the earlier case.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. The court should grant defendant’s motion because plaintiff has been declared a vexatious litigant by a {<i>state/federal</i>} court in {<i>an action/a proceeding</i>} based on the same or substantially similar {<i>facts/transactions/occurrences</i>}. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §11.054(3). {<i>Identify the cause number, style, court, county, and date of filing of other case.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Because plaintiff {<i>state basis for determining that plaintiff is a vexatious litigant</i>}, the court, after notice and a hearing, should order plaintiff to provide security to defendant in the amount of ${<i>amount</i>} to cover reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the litigation, including costs and attorney fees.</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to determine that plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and requests that the court stay the proceedings and order plaintiff to furnish security in the amount of at least ${<i>amount</i>}.</p>
