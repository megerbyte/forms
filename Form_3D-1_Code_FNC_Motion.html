  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c3">{</span><i class="c4">DISMISS/STAY</i><span class="c3">} FOR FORUM NON CONVENIENS</span></p>

  <p class="western c6">Defendant asks the court to {<i>dismiss/stay</i>} this suit on grounds of forum non conveniens, as authorized by Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 71.051. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Code FNC Motion,” ch. 3-D, §3, p. 175.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c6">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c7">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c6">3. {<i>State facts relevant to the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">4. Defendant attaches affidavits to this motion to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c7">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 5</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">5. This suit involves a plaintiff who is not a legal resident of Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Single plaintiff,” ch. 3-D, §3.3.1(1), p. 176.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">5. There are {<i>number</i>} plaintiffs in this suit, some of whom are legal residents of Texas and others who are not. {<i>Identify which plaintiffs are legal residents of Texas and which are not.</i>} The Texas plaintiffs were joined solely for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining jurisdiction in Texas. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). The claims would be more properly heard in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. <i>Id.</i> {<i>Demonstrate why joinder of Texas plaintiffs is improper.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Multiple plaintiffs,” ch. 3-D, §3.3.1(2), p. 176.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">5. There are {<i>number</i>} plaintiffs in this suit, some of whom are legal residents of Texas and others who are not. {<i>Identify which plaintiffs are legal residents and which are not.</i>} The occurrence that gave rise to the claims by the Texas plaintiffs did not arise out of the same occurrence that gave rise to the claims of the nonresidents. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(e). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Multiple plaintiffs,” ch. 3-D, §3.3.1(2), p. 176.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">6. In the interest of justice, the action would be more properly heard in a forum outside Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b). “Interest of justice” is an issue of fundamental fairness to be determined on a case-by-case basis. <i>Baker v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.</i>, 985 S.W.2d 272, 276-77 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1999, pet. denied). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Interest of justice,” ch. 3-D, §3.3.2, p. 176.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">7. The court should grant defendant’s motion for the following reasons:</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. The courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} are available to decide plaintiff’s cause of action. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(1). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. The courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} offer an adequate remedy for plaintiff’s cause of action. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(2). {<i>Show that alternate forum would allow plaintiff’s claim or provide similar relief.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. Maintaining this suit in Texas would work a substantial injustice on defendant because {<i>explain injustice of forcing defendant to defend in Texas</i>}. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(3).</p>

  <p class="western c8">d. The courts of {<i>alternate forum</i>} can exercise jurisdiction over all the defendants properly joined in plaintiff’s suit. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(4). {<i>Identify properly joined defendants and show why alternate forum can exercise jurisdiction over each. If necessary, file a stipulation agreeing to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by that forum.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">8. The private interests of the litigants will be better served in {<i>alternate forum</i>} than in Texas for the following reasons:</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT FACTORS BELOW</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. Access to sources of proof will be easier in {<i>alternate forum</i>} than in Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. Compulsory process for the attendance of unwilling witnesses is available in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. The cost of obtaining the presence of willing witnesses will be lower in {<i>alternate forum</i>} than in Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">d. A view of the premises is possible in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">e. The enforcement of the judgment is easier in {<i>alternate forum</i>} than in Texas. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">9. The public interests will be better served in {<i>alternate forum</i>} as the proper forum for the following reasons:</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT FACTORS BELOW</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. The administrative burden on the {<i>alternate forum</i>} court is less than on this court. Specifically, {<i>identify reasons, e.g., congested docket</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. {<i>Alternate forum</i>} has an interest in adjudicating this case, and Texas does not. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. {<i>Alternate forum</i>}’s law will control the disposition of this case. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">10. The act or omission that plaintiff alleges resulted in {<i>his/her</i>} claim for {<i>injury/death</i>} occurred in {<i>alternate forum</i>}. <i>See</i> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(5). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No Texas injury,” ch. 3-D, §3.3.3(5)(c), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">11. This court’s {<i>dismissal/stay</i>} of plaintiff’s cause of action based on forum non conveniens will not result in unreasonable duplication or proliferation of litigation. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.051(b)(6). {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No duplication or proliferation,” ch. 3-D, §3.3.3(6), p. 177.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c6">12. Because plaintiff’s suit can be properly heard in {<i>alternate forum</i>}, because defendant would be prejudiced if forced to defend in Texas, and because the private and public interests would be better served if plaintiff’s case were heard in {<i>alternate forum</i>}, the court should grant defendant’s motion for forum non conveniens.</p>

  <p class="western c7">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c6">13. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set defendant’s motion for forum non conveniens for hearing at least 30 days before trial, provide the parties with 21 days’ notice of the hearing, and, after the hearing, grant defendant’s motion and sign an order {<i>dismissing/staying</i>} plaintiff’s causes of action.</p>
