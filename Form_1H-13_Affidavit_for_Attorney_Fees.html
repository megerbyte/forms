  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">STATE OF TEXAS §<br>
  {_______} COUNTY §</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c3">AFFIDAVIT OF {</span><i class="c4">NAME OF ATTORNEY</i><span class="c3">}</span></p>

  <p class="western c5">Before me, the undersigned notary, on this day personally appeared {<i>name of attorney</i>}, the affiant, a person whose identity is known to me. After I administered an oath to affiant, affiant testified:</p>

  <p class="western c5">1. “My name is {<i>name</i> <i>of attorney</i>}. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and capable of making this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. I am an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Texas.</p>

  <p class="western c5">3. {<i>Party</i>} retained me to represent {<i>him/her/it</i>} in this suit for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}. I have personal knowledge of this case and the work performed.</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. The following describes my experience and expertise in this area of law. {<i>Describe experience and expertise.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. It was necessary for {<i>party</i>} to retain an attorney to represent {<i>him/her/it</i>} in this matter {<i>add if applicable: as well as paralegals and legal assistants to work in this case</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD PARAGRAPHS 6-8 IF APPLICABLE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. The paralegals and legal assistants assigned to this case (1) are qualified by education, experience, and training to perform the services required; (2) have knowledge of the legal system, principles, and procedures; (3) were supervised by an attorney; (4) performed tasks that were traditionally done by an attorney; and (5) performed services that were reasonable and necessary.</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. {<i>Party</i>}’s retention of me on this case precluded me from accepting other employment. In particular, the following time limitations were imposed: {<i>describe limitations</i>}. Because of the {<i>identify factors making the case undesirable, e.g., uniqueness of the issues, difficulty or complexity of the case, unpopularity of the client</i>}, this case may be seen as undesirable by some attorneys, making the retention of an attorney difficult.</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. The novelty and difficulty of the questions involved in this case required me to spend {<i>state approximate amount of time</i>} {<i>prosecuting/defending</i>} this cause of action by investigating claims; drafting pleadings, questions, and responses; engaging in discovery; attending hearings; and taking other necessary actions, in performing my legal services properly.</p>

  <p class="western c5">9. {<i>Party</i>} agreed to compensate me for my work based on {<i>identify arrangement, e.g., an hourly fee, a contingency fee</i>}. {<i>State details of the fee agreement.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">10. Based on our fee agreement, {<i>party</i>} incurred attorney {<i>add if applicable: and paralegal</i>} fees in the amount of ${<i>amount</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">11. In my opinion, the reasonable value of attorney fees, costs, and expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by {<i>party</i>} are as follows:</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">a. ${<i>Amount</i>}, for representing {<i>party</i>} in trial and through entry of judgment.</p>

  <p class="western c6">b. ${<i>Amount</i>}, for representing {<i>party</i>} on appeal to the {<i>number</i>} Court of Appeals.</p>

  <p class="western c6">c. ${<i>Amount</i>}, for representing {<i>party</i>} on appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas.</p>

  <p class="western c5">12. The attorney services and fees charged in this case were necessary, were reasonable, and were incurred in the {<i>prosecution/defense</i>} of this suit. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 13</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">13. The fees claimed in this affidavit were segregated from the fees incurred in the {<i>prosecution/defense</i>} of this suit {<i>on claims for which attorney fees are not recoverable/against other parties who are not liable for attorney fees</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">13. All claims arose out of the same transaction, relied on the same facts, or were otherwise so intertwined that the fees claimed in this affidavit could not be segregated. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 14</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">14. Because the claim for attorney fees may be included in a suit for {<i>breach of an oral contract/breach of a written contract/sworn account/rendered services/performed labor/furnished materials/freight overcharges/lost or damaged freight/killed or injured stock</i>}, which is a claim listed in Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 38.001, the court can take judicial notice of the usual and customary attorney fees and the contents of the case file without receiving any further evidence. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §38.004.”</p>

  <p class="western c5">14. The fees I charged in this case are customarily charged in this area for the same or similar services for an attorney with my experience, reputation, and ability, considering {<i>add if applicable: the nature and length of my relationship with {party},</i>} the {<i>amount in/type of</i>} controversy, the time limitations imposed, and the results obtained.”</p>
