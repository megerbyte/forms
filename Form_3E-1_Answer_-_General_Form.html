  <p class="western c3">C. Verified Pleas</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c6">E. Counterclaim - {</span><i class="c7">Name of counterclaim</i><span class="c6">}</span></p>

  <p class="western c4">5. {<i>Identify cause of action against plaintiff, e.g., plaintiff breached plaintiff’s fiduciary duty to defendant</i>. <i>In separately numbered paragraphs, identify elements and facts supporting the counterclaim.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Counterclaims,” ch. 3-E, §6.1, p. 188.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. Co-defendant, {<i>name of co-defendant</i>}, is liable to defendant, {<i>name of defendant</i>}, for {<i>identify cause of action against co-defendant</i>}. {<i>In separately numbered paragraphs, identify elements and facts supporting the cross-claim.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Cross-claims,” ch. 3-E, §6.2, p. 189.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">G. Proportionate Responsibility of Unknown Criminal</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Defendant designates an unknown criminal as a responsible third party within the meaning of Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 33.004(j). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “RTP - unknown criminal,” ch. 3-E, §6.4.3, p. 190.</i>} The unknown criminal, {<i>John Doe/Jane Doe</i>}, is a responsible third party for the following reasons:</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. {<i>John Doe/Jane Doe</i>} committed a criminal act that caused the loss or injury that is the subject of the lawsuit. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §33.004(j).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. The act committed by {<i>John Doe/Jane Doe</i>} was criminal. {<i>State sufficient facts to show a reasonable probability the act was criminal.</i>} {<i>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §33.004(j)(1).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. All known identifying characteristics of {<i>John Doe/Jane Doe</i>} are the following: {<i>state all identifying characteristics known when the answer is filed</i>}. {<i>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §33.004(j)(2).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">d. {<i>John Doe/Jane Doe</i>} is responsible for the criminal act because {<i>state sufficient facts about the unknown criminal’s responsibility to satisfy the pleading requirements of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure</i>}. {<i>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §33.004(j)(3).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">H. Exemplary Damages</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. If defendant is found liable for exemplary damages, those damaged must be capped under the Texas Damages Act and the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s COA</i><i>, “Capping Exemplary Damages,” ch. 46-B, §7, p. 1139.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">I. Response to Request for Injunctive Relief</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. Defendant objects to plaintiff’s request for {<i>describe injunctive relief sought</i>} on the following grounds: {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Respondent’s Response,” ch. 2-C, §8, p. 94.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE STATEMENTS</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">a. Plaintiff’s application for injunctive relief does not show that plaintiff has a probable right to the relief plaintiff seeks on a final hearing of the case. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Probable right to relief,” ch. 2-C, §4.2.2, p. 88.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">b. Plaintiff’s application for injunctive relief does not show that plaintiff will sustain probable injury if no relief is granted. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Probable injury,” ch. 2-C, §4.2.3, p. 88.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">c. Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law without the need for injunctive relief. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Inadequate remedy,” ch. 2-C, §4.2.3(3), p. 89.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">d. If the court grants a temporary injunction, the injunction will accomplish the whole object of plaintiff’s suit. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} A trial court cannot grant a temporary injunction that gives the plaintiff all the relief plaintiff seeks without a trial on the merits. {<i>Texas Foundries, Inc. v. International Moulders &amp; Foundry Workers’ Un., 248 S.W.2d 460, 464 (Tex. 1952).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">e. If the court grants a temporary injunction, it will destroy, rather than preserve, the status quo. The status quo to be preserved by a temporary injunction is the last, actual, peaceable, noncontested status that preceded the controversy resulting in the suit. {<i>Transport Co. v. Robertson Transports, Inc., 261 S.W.2d 549, 553-54 (Tex. 1953).</i>} The status quo that should be preserved-but instead will be destroyed-by the requested temporary injunction is {<i>elaborate</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c8">f. Plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive relief because plaintiff is guilty of inequitable conduct. {<i>Elaborate, identifying inequitable conduct, e.g., laches, unclean hands.</i>} {<i>San Miguel v. City of Windcrest, 40 S.W.3d 104, 110 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, no pet.).</i>} Plaintiff’s conduct precludes equitable relief because the conduct affected the equitable relations with defendant. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>Office Employees Int’l Un. v. Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co., 314 S.W.2d 315, 325 (Tex. App.—Austin 1958, writ ref. n.r.e.).</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">g. Plaintiff’s proposed order for injunctive relief does not set forth the defendant’s duties in clear, specific, and unambiguous terms, as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 683. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c8">h. Plaintiff did not verify the application for injunction, as required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 682. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">J. Attorney Fees</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Defendant is entitled to recover reasonable and necessary attorney fees under {<i>identify code, statute, or contract permitting recovery of attorney fees</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s COA</i><i>, “Attorney Fees,” ch. 49, p. 1161;</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s COA Pleadings</i><i>, FORMS 49.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">K. Jury Demand</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. Defendant demands a jury trial and tenders the appropriate fee with the answer. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Request for Jury Trial,” ch. 5-B, p. 241.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">L. Special Exceptions</p>

  <p class="western c4">12. Defendant specially excepts to plaintiff’s original petition, paragraph {<i>number</i>} regarding damages, and asks the court to require plaintiff to specify the maximum amount of damages that plaintiff claims. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Unliquidated damages,” ch. 3-G, §2.2.5, p. 198. For the order on special exceptions, see FORM 3G:2.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">13. {<i>For other special exceptions, see FORM 3G:1.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">M. Request for Disclosure</p>

  <p class="western c4">14. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 194, defendant requests that plaintiff disclose, within 30 days of the service of this request, the information or material described in Rule 194.2. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Content of request,” ch. 6-D, §3.2, p. 392.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">N. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">15. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to dismiss this suit or render judgment that plaintiff take nothing, assess costs against plaintiff, and award all other relief to which defendant is entitled. {<i>If defendant asserts claims for affirmative relief, include a request for rendition of judgment on those claims. See FORM 2B:1.</i>}</p>
