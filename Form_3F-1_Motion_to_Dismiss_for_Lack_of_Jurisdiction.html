  <p class="western c1">Form 3F:1 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION</p>

  <p class="western c4">Defendant asks the court to dismiss plaintiff’s suit for lack of jurisdiction. {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Plea to the Jurisdiction-Challenging the Court,” ch. 3-F, p. 191.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c2">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. Plaintiff’s petition alleges {<i>state factual allegations relevant to jurisdiction</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. {<i>State additional facts relevant to jurisdiction.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. Defendant attaches affidavits to this motion to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c2">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. The purpose of a plea to the jurisdiction is to dismiss a cause of action without regard to whether the claim has merit. <i>Bland ISD v. Blue</i>, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. The court must decide whether plaintiff has affirmatively demonstrated this court’s jurisdiction to hear this suit, based on the facts alleged by plaintiff and, when necessary to resolve jurisdictional facts, on evidence submitted by the parties. <i>See Texas Dep’t of Parks &amp; Wildlife v. Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 227 (Tex. 2004); <i>Bland ISD</i>, 34 S.W.3d at 555; <i>see, e.g.</i>, <i>State v. Sledge</i>, 36 S.W.3d 152, 155 (Tex. App.— Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet. denied) (trial court conducted hearing and received oral testimony, affidavits, exhibits, and stipulations).</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. This court does not have jurisdiction over this lawsuit because</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE GROUND</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(A) there are no justiciable issues in this case that this court can resolve. The plaintiff’s petition does not allege a real controversy between the parties that could be resolved by the judicial relief plaintiff seeks. <i>See In re Nolo Press</i>, 991 S.W.2d 768, 778 (Tex. 1999) (district court did not have authority to modify order of Supreme Court); <i>State Bar v. Gomez</i>, 891 S.W.2d 243, 245-46 (Tex. 1994) (district court did not have authority to compel State Bar or Supreme Court to implement mandatory pro bono). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No justiciable issue,” ch. 3-F, §3.1, p. 192.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(B) another court has exclusive jurisdiction over this suit. <i>Jansen v. Fitzpatrick</i>, 14 S.W.3d 426, 430-31 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.); <i>see also</i> <i>Speer v. Stover</i>, 685 S.W.2d 22, 23 (Tex. 1985) (district court did not have jurisdiction over case pending in probate court); <i>cf. Geary v. Peavy</i>, 878 S.W.2d 602, 604-05 (Tex. 1994) (Minnesota court had jurisdiction over child custody case). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Another court has exclusive jurisdiction,” ch. 3-F, §3.4, p. 193.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(C) the plaintiff has not and cannot affirmatively demonstrate that this court has jurisdiction to hear this lawsuit under the Texas Tort Claims Act or any other statute waiving the government’s immunity from suit. <i>Texas Dep’t of Crim. Justice v. Miller</i>, 51 S.W.3d 583, 587 (Tex. 2001). Simply put, the Texas Legislature has not waived defendant’s immunity from suit for this claim. Plaintiff’s lawsuit involves a claim against the {<i>identify governmental entity, e.g., State of Texas</i>} for damages arising out of {<i>identify basis for suit</i>}. A governmental entity cannot be sued for damages unless the Legislature has waived that entity’s immunity from suit for that specific claim. <i>Texas DOT v. Jones</i>, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638 (Tex. 1999); <i>Federal Sign v. Texas S. Univ.</i>, 951 S.W.2d 401, 405 (Tex. 1997). Nothing in the Texas Tort Claims Act or any other statute or act of the Texas Legislature gives plaintiff the authority to file this suit against defendant. {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Governmental immunity from suit,” ch. 3-F, §3.6, p. 193;</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s COA</i><i>, “Immunity from suit,” ch. 22-A, §3.4.1, p. 685.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(D) this suit is preempted by ERISA, which is jurisdictional. <i>See Southland Life Ins. Co. v. Estate of Small</i>, 806 S.W.2d 800, 801 (Tex. 1991). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Federal preemption,” ch. 3-F, §3.7, p. 193.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(E) the cause of action alleged by plaintiff was extinguished by the death of {<i>party</i>}. <i>See Whatley v. Bacon</i>, 649 S.W.2d 297, 299 (Tex. 1983) (when party to divorce suit dies before judgment is rendered, the suit should be dismissed); <i>Orr v. International Bank of Commerce</i>, 649 S.W.2d 769, 772 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1983, no writ) (suit for usury does not survive death of either party). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Death,” ch. 3-F, §3.8, p. 194.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(F) an administrative agency has exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute. <i>Subaru, Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc.</i>, 84 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2002). When an agency’s jurisdiction is exclusive, courts must defer to the agency as a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction, and a dismissal is mandatory. <i>Id.</i> {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Administrative agency has exclusive jurisdiction,” ch. 3-F, §3.5, p. 193.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(G) the plaintiff has fabricated jurisdiction by fraudulently alleging an amount in controversy to make it appear that this court has jurisdiction. <i>See</i> <i>Texas Dep’t of Parks &amp; Wildlife v. Miranda</i>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 224 &amp; n.4 (Tex. 2004); <i>Delk v. City of Dallas</i>, 560 S.W.2d 519, 520 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1977, no writ). Defendant’s burden in this case is to prove the allegations of the amount in controversy in the plaintiff’s pleadings are false and were falsely made for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Fabricated jurisdiction,” ch. 3-F, §3.10, p. 194.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(H) plaintiff has no standing to bring this suit. <i>M.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr. v. Novak</i>, 52 S.W.3d 704, 710-11 (Tex. 2001). Because standing is a component of subject-matter jurisdiction, a plaintiff’s lack of standing deprives this court of jurisdiction over the claims asserted in plaintiff’s petition. <i>See</i> <i>Texas Ass’n of Bus. v. Texas Air Control Bd.</i>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 443 (Tex. 1993). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No standing,” ch. 3-F, §3.2, p. 193.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(I) plaintiff has asserted a controversy that clearly involves ecclesiastical matters into which the courts are prohibited from delving. <i>See Hawkins v. Friendship Missionary Baptist Ch.</i>, 69 S.W.3d 756, 758-59 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.); <i>Green v. United Pentecostal Ch. Int’l</i>, 899 S.W.2d 28, 30-31 (Tex. App.—Austin 1995, writ denied); <i>Patterson v. Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary</i>, 858 S.W.2d 602, 604-05 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1993, no writ). Secular courts cannot constitutionally determine the truth or falsity of religious matters. <i>Tilton v. Marshall</i>, 925 S.W.2d 672, 678-79 (Tex. 1996); <i>see also Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich</i>, 426 U.S. 696, 713 (1976) (religious controversies are not the proper subject of civil court inquiry). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Religious matters,” ch. 3-F, §3.11, p. 194.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(J) the cause of action asserted by plaintiff is not ripe. <i>See Waco ISD v. Gibson</i>, 22 S.W.3d 849, 851-52 (Tex. 2000). A case is not ripe when a determination of whether the plaintiff has a concrete injury depends on contingent or hypothetical facts, or on events that have not yet happened. <i>Id.</i> at 852. {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Not ripe,” ch. 3-F, §3.3, p. 193.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(K) plaintiff has not complied with the statute on which the cause of action is based, and that statute defines, enlarges, or restricts the types of claims the court may decide or the relief it may award. <i>See</i> <i>Sierra Club v. Texas Nat. Res. Conserv. Comm’n</i>, 26 S.W.3d 684, 688 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000), <i>aff’d</i>, 70 S.W.3d 809 (Tex. 2002). If the trial court has authority to adjudicate the type of controversy alleged in the suit, the plaintiff’s failure to comply with some statutory requirement is a jurisdictional defect that cannot be cured. <i>See Hubenak v. San Jacinto Gas Transmission Co.</i>, 141 S.W.3d 172, 183 (Tex. 2004); <i>Dubai Pet. Co. v. Kazi</i>, 12 S.W.3d 71, 75-76 (Tex. 2000). {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Statutory causes of action,” ch. 3-F, §3.9, p. 194.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">(L) plaintiff named an estate as the defendant without any reference to the personal representative. <i>See Henson v. Estate of Crow</i>, 734 S.W.2d 648, 649 (Tex. 1987); <i>Miller v. Estate of Self</i>, 113 S.W.3d 554, 556 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2003, no pet.). The court does not have jurisdiction if the personal representative has not been served with citation and has not participated in the suit. <i>See</i> <i>Miller</i>, 113 S.W.3d at 557. {<i>See</i> <i class="c3">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Estate as defendant,” ch. 3-F, §3.12, p. 194.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. {<i>Elaborate on argument of lack of jurisdiction.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Because it is clear from plaintiff’s pleadings and the evidence submitted with this motion that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear plaintiff’s cause of action, the court should dismiss plaintiff’s suit.</p>

  <p class="western c2">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set this motion for submission {<i>with/without</i>} a hearing and, after considering the pleadings, grant defendant’s motion and dismiss plaintiff’s suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>
