  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SEVER &amp;</p>

  <p class="western c3">TRANSFER VENUE AS TO ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS</p>

  <p class="western c4">Defendant files this motion to transfer venue and asks the court to sever the cause of action as to one of the plaintiffs and transfer that part of the case from {<i>current</i>} County to {<i>proposed</i>} County.</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. The plaintiffs in this suit are {<i>names</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Plaintiffs sued defendant in {<i>current</i>} County for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>} cannot establish proper venue independently of every other plaintiff and cannot establish proper joinder under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.003. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “File motion to sever &amp; transfer,” ch. 3-C, §2.4.3, p. 164; “Venue or joinder proper to all plaintiffs,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.4, p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD PARAGRAPH 4 IF SPECIAL APPEARANCE IS PENDING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. The relief requested in this motion is subject to the court’s ruling on defendant’s special appearance. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Due Order of Pleadings,” ch. 3-A, §3, p. 147.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. Defendant specifically denies plaintiff’s venue facts that {<i>deny each venue fact pleaded by plaintiff, e.g., a substantial part of the events giving rise to this suit arose in this county, defendant has its principal office in this county</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Denial of venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(1), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. Defendant specifically pleads that this case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County because {<i>plead venue facts supporting transfer to county of proper venue</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Allege specific county,” ch. 3-C, §2.4.2, p. 164.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Defendant attaches affidavits to this motion to establish defendant’s venue facts and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. On the issue of venue, plaintiff has the burden to offer prima facie proof, and defendant is not permitted to offer rebuttal evidence. <i>See Surgitek, Bristol-Myers Corp. v. Abel</i>, 997 S.W.2d 598, 602 (Tex. 1999).</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. On the issue of joinder, Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code places the initial burden on plaintiff to offer prima facie proof of the four joinder elements listed in Section 15.003(a). <i>Surgitek</i>, 997 S.W.2d at 602-03. On this issue, defendant may offer rebuttal evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 603. If defendant’s joinder evidence rebuts plaintiff’s prima facie proof, the trial court may consider all available evidence to resolve the dispute. <i>Id.</i> Thus, in a hearing for a Section 15.003(a) joinder determination, the trial court can permit more evidence than it would in a venue hearing. <i>Surgitek</i>, 997 S.W.2d at 603.</p>

  <p class="western c3">Improper Venue</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. Venue of this case is improper in {<i>current</i>} County as to plaintiff {<i>name</i>} because this county is not a county of proper venue as to this plaintiff under any of the venue rules. Contrary to plaintiff’s allegations, {<i>current</i>} County is not a county of proper venue under {<i>a mandatory venue provision/a permissive venue provision/the general venue rule</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">Proper Venue</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 11</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. The severed case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County, which is a proper county as to this plaintiff under a mandatory venue provision in {<i>specify mandatory provision, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.011</i>}, because {<i>specify reason, e.g., this suit involves partition of real property in Lubbock County</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Mandatory Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §4, p. 118.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. The severed case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County, which is a proper county as to this plaintiff under a permissive venue provision, because no mandatory venue provision applies. Venue is permissive in {<i>proposed</i>} County under {<i>identify statute, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.031</i>} because {<i>specify reason, e.g., this is a suit for a debt of an estate and the proposed county is the county where the estate is being administered</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Permissive Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §6, p. 122.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. The severed case should be transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County, which is a proper county as to this plaintiff under the general venue rule, Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.002(a), because no mandatory venue provision applies. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General Venue Rule,” ch. 2-G, §5, p. 121.</i>} Venue is proper in {<i>proposed</i>} County because it {<i>is/was</i>} the county</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(A) where all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(1). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(B) of defendant’s residence at the time the cause of action accrued. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(2). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(C) of defendant’s principal office in this state. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(3); <i>see In re Missouri Pac. R.R.</i>, 998 S.W.2d 212, 216-17 (Tex. 1999) (FELA case). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(D) where plaintiff resided at the time the cause of action accrued. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.002(a)(4). {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">Improper Joinder</p>

  <p class="western c4">12. When a plaintiff cannot establish proper venue independently of every other plaintiff, {<i>he/she/it</i>} must establish proper joinder under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.003(a). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i>, <i>“Venue or joinder proper to all plaintiffs,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.4, p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">13. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>} cannot establish, independently of every other plaintiff, proper joinder under Section 15.003(a) because {<i>explain</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i>, <i>“Joinder proper under §15.003(a),” ch. 3-C, §2.6.4(2), p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTION D IF APPROPRIATE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Transfer for Convenience</p>

  <p class="western c4">14. {<i>Insert allegations from FORM 3C:3.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Venue convenient elsewhere,” ch. 3-C, §2.3.5, p. 163.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c4">15. Because plaintiff {<i>name</i>} cannot establish proper venue independently of every other plaintiff and cannot establish proper joinder under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.003(a), plaintiff {<i>name</i>}’s case should be severed and transferred to {<i>proposed</i>} County.</p>

  <p class="western c3">F. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">16. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set {<i>his/her/its</i>} motion to sever and transfer venue for hearing and, after the hearing, grant defendant’s motion and transfer plaintiff {<i>name</i>}’s case to {<i>proposed</i>} County. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Request hearing,” ch. 3-C, §2.2.5, p. 162.</i>}</p>
