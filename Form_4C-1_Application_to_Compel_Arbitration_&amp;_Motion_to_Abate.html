  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">{<i>PARTY</i>}’S APPLICATION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION &amp;</p>

  <p class="western c3">VERIFIED MOTION TO ABATE PROCEEDINGS PENDING ARBITRATION</p>

  <p class="western c5">{<i>Party</i>} asks the court to order this case to arbitration and abate this lawsuit. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Who may compel arbitration,” ch. 4-C, §3.2.2, p. 225.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c5">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">3. Discovery in this suit is governed by a Level {<i>1/2/3</i>} discovery control plan. The discovery period {<i>will end/ended</i>} on {<i>date</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Discovery Control Plans,” ch. 6-A, §7, p. 332.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. {<i>All/Most/A significant part/No significant part/None</i>} of the discovery has been completed.</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. This case is set for {<i>trial/hearing</i>} on {<i>date</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. On {<i>date</i>}, the parties signed a contract to {<i>describe purpose of contract</i>}. Attached to this application as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} is a copy of the contract, which is incorporated by reference. That contract contained a requirement that</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(A) all disputes be submitted to arbitration.</p>

  <p class="western c6">(B) the following disputes be submitted to arbitration: {<i>specify disputes subject to arbitration</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. The arbitration agreement, as part of the contract, was made in consideration of {<i>describe consideration</i>}. {<i>Party</i>} fully performed all of {<i>his/her/its</i>} duties under the contract.</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. On {<i>date</i>}, a dispute arose between the parties relating to the subject of the contract.</p>

  <p class="western c5">9. On {<i>date</i>}, plaintiff filed this suit, invoking the court’s jurisdiction over the dispute subject to the arbitration agreement.</p>

  <p class="western c5">10. {<i>State other facts relevant to the application.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">11. {<i>Party</i>} attaches affidavits to this application to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c5">12. Although the parties agreed to arbitrate {<i>all disputes between them/this dispute</i>}, {<i>adverse party</i>} refused to arbitrate {<i>add if applicable: and, instead, filed this suit</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Who may compel arbitration,” ch. 4-C, §3.2.2, p. 225.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">13. Once a party seeking to compel arbitration establishes there is a valid agreement to arbitrate and that the claims raised are within the agreement’s scope, the trial court must compel arbitration. <i>See In re Oakwood Mobile Homes, Inc.</i>, 987 S.W.2d 571, 573 (Tex. 1999); <i>Cantella &amp; Co. v. Goodwin</i>, 924 S.W.2d 943, 944 (Tex. 1996). <i>See generally</i> 9 U.S.C. §4 (Federal Arbitration Act); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §171.001 et seq. (Texas Arbitration Act). {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Who may compel arbitration,” ch. 4-C, §3.2.2, p. 225.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 14-16</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>For Federal Arbitration Act</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">14. The arbitration agreement is valid because the parties agreed to arbitrate under the Federal Arbitration Act and the dispute between the parties concerns a transaction involving interstate commerce. {<i>Elaborate and identify factors supporting interstate commerce, e.g., location of defendant’s headquarters is in another state, materials used or purchased were transported across state lines, parts used or purchased were manufactured in different states, billings were prepared out of state, the parties used interstate mail and phone calls. In re Big 8 Food Stores, Ltd., 166 S.W.3d 869, 876 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2005, orig. proceeding); see Jack B. Anglin Co. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 269-70 (Tex. 1992).</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),” ch. 4-C, §3.1, p. 224.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>For Texas Arbitration Act</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">15. The arbitration agreement is valid, and the factual allegations in plaintiff’s petition fall within the scope of the agreement. <i>See J. M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster</i>, 128 S.W.3d 223, 227 (Tex. 2003); <i>Oakwood Mobile Homes</i>, 987 S.W.2d at 573. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Requirements to compel arbitration,” ch. 4-C, §3.2.3, p. 226.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">16. The arbitration agreement is binding because each party, on the advice of counsel, agreed in writing to arbitrate, and the agreement is signed by each party and each party’s attorney. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §171.002(b), (c).</p>

  <p class="western c5">17. When a court orders the parties to arbitration, it must abate the proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. <i>See</i> {<i>9 U.S.C. §3/Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §171.025</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Stay,” ch. 4-C, §3.5.2, p. 229.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c5">18. Because the parties agreed to arbitrate {<i>all disputes between them/this dispute</i>}, and {<i>adverse party</i>} refused to arbitrate {<i>add if applicable: and instead filed this suit</i>}, the court should abate this suit and compel {<i>adverse party</i>} to submit to arbitration.</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c5">19. For these reasons, {<i>party</i>} asks this court to set {<i>his/her/its</i>} application to compel arbitration for hearing, grant {<i>party</i>}’s application to compel, order the parties to arbitration, and abate this lawsuit pending the outcome of the arbitration.</p>
