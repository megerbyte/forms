  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO</p>

  <p class="western c3">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SEVER &amp; TRANSFER</p>

  <p class="western c4">Plaintiff asks the court to deny defendant’s motion to sever and transfer venue.</p>

  <p class="western c3">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; other plaintiffs are {<i>names</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Plaintiffs sued defendant in {<i>current</i>} County for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 3-7</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. In defendant’s motion to transfer, defendant did not specifically deny any of plaintiff’s venue facts. Instead of a specific denial, defendant made a global denial of all the venue facts by stating “{<i>quote defendant’s denial</i>}.” <i>See Bleeker v. Villarreal</i>, 941 S.W.2d 163, 176 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1996, writ dism’d) (denying “the fact that venue is proper” is not a specific denial); <i>Maranatha Temple, Inc. v. Enterprise Prods. Co.</i>, 833 S.W.2d 736, 740 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied) (same). A global denial does not satisfy the requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 87(3)(a). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Denial of venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(1), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. In defendant’s motion to transfer venue, defendant specifically denied that {<i>identify plaintiff’s venue facts that defendant specifically denied, e.g., a substantial part of the events giving rise to this suit arose in this county, defendant has its principal office in this county</i>}. Contrary to defendant’s specific denial of venue facts, {<i>state venue facts as pleaded in petition</i>}. {<i>Elaborate, stating venue facts that support venue.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Proof of denied venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.7.1, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>} amended {<i>his/her/its</i>} original petition to {<i>add/subtract</i>} the following {<i>facts/claims</i>}: {<i>identify venue facts or claims added or subtracted</i>}. Plaintiff filed the amended petition at least seven days before the hearing on the motion to transfer. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} The amended petition supports venue in this county because {<i>explain</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Amend petition,” ch. 3-C, §2.8.1, p. 167.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>} specifically denies defendant’s venue facts that {<i>list each venue fact pleaded in defendant’s motion to transfer</i>}. Instead, {<i>state venue facts</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Deny defendant’s venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.6, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>} can establish independently of every other plaintiff {<i>proper venue/proper joinder under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.003</i>}. {<i>Elaborate, stating venue facts that support venue or joinder.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Venue or joinder proper to all plaintiffs,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.4, p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. Plaintiff {<i>name</i>} attaches affidavits to this response and incorporates them by reference. By these affidavits, plaintiff makes a prima facie case of {<i>his/her/its</i>} venue facts and of proper joinder. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Prima facie proof,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(2), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. Plaintiff has the burden to establish, independently of every other plaintiff, that either (1) venue is proper as to this plaintiff in this county, or (2) this plaintiff was properly joined under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.003. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Venue or joinder proper to all plaintiffs,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.4, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">10. On the issue of venue, plaintiff has the burden to offer prima facie proof, and defendant is not permitted to offer rebuttal evidence. <i>See Surgitek, Bristol-Myers Corp. v. Abel</i>, 997 S.W.2d 598, 602 (Tex. 1999).</p>

  <p class="western c4">11. On the issue of joinder, plaintiff has the initial burden to offer prima facie proof of the four joinder elements listed in Section 15.003(a). <i>Surgitek</i>, 997 S.W.2d at 602-03.</p>

  <p class="western c3">Waiver</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 12 IF APPLICABLE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">12. Defendant waived {<i>his/her/its</i>} venue challenge because {<i>he/she/it</i>} did not specifically deny any of plaintiff {<i>name</i>}’s venue facts. Because plaintiff’s venue facts were properly pleaded and are unchallenged, they must be taken as true. Tex. R. Civ. P. 87(3)(a); <i>Sanes v. Clark</i>, 25 S.W.3d 800, 803 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000, pet. denied). The plaintiff’s venue facts that establish proper venue in this county are {<i>state plaintiff’s venue facts that establish proper venue</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Denial of venue facts,” ch. 3-C, §2.11.4(1), p. 168.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">12. Defendant waived {<i>his/her/its</i>} venue challenge because {<i>he/she/it</i>} filed the motion after the deadline required by both Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 86(1) and Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.063. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Allege waiver,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.7, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">Proper Venue</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 13</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">13. Venue is proper in this county as to this plaintiff because {<i>current</i>} County is a county of {<i>mandatory/permissive</i>} venue.</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD ONE OF THE FOLLOWING</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(A) A suit must be filed in the county of mandatory venue. In this case, plaintiff filed this suit in this county as required by a mandatory provision in {<i>identify statute prescribing mandatory venue, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.011</i>}. {<i>Elaborate</i>, <i>stating facts that comply with mandatory venue provision.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Mandatory Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §4, p. 118.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">(B) When no mandatory venue applies, a suit may be filed in any county of permissive venue. In this case, plaintiff {<i>name</i>} filed this suit in this county under a permissive provision in {<i>identify statute providing permissive venue, e.g., Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.031</i>}. {<i>Elaborate</i>, <i>stating facts that comply with permissive venue provision.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Permissive Venue Provisions,” ch. 2-G, §6, p. 122.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">13. Venue is proper in this county as to this plaintiff because no mandatory venue provision applies and {<i>current</i>} County is a county of a proper venue under the general venue rule, Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.002(a). When no mandatory venue applies, a suit may be filed in any county under the general venue rule. In this case, plaintiff {<i>name</i>} filed this suit in this county allowed under {<i>identify specific subsection providing general venue, e.g., section 15.002(a)(1)</i>}. That provision permits venue in this county because {<i>state why, e.g., the automobile accident occurred in this county</i>}. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General Venue Rule,” ch. 2-G, §5, p. 121; “Venue proper under general rule,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.1, p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">Proper Joinder</p>

  <p class="western c4">14. Even if plaintiff {<i>name</i>} cannot establish proper venue independently of every other plaintiff, {<i>he/she/it</i>} can defeat defendant’s motion by establishing, independently of every other plaintiff, proper joinder under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code section 15.003(a). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i>, <i>“Joinder proper under §15.003(a),” ch. 3-C, §2.6.4(2), p. 165.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">15. Plaintiff’s joinder in this suit is proper under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.003(a)(1). {<i>Show why joinder is proper under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">16. Maintaining venue in {<i>current</i>} County will not unfairly prejudice any other party. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.003(a)(2). {<i>Show how other parties will not be unfairly prejudiced.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">17. There is an essential need to have the claims of plaintiff’s suit tried in {<i>current</i>} County. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.003(a)(3); <i>Surgitek, Bristol-Myers Corp. v. Abel</i>, 997 S.W.2d 598, 604 (Tex. 1999). {<i>Show why there is an essential need to try plaintiff’s suit in this county.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">18. {<i>Current</i>} County is a fair and convenient venue for plaintiff {<i>name</i>} and all defendants. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §15.003(a)(4). {<i>Show why this county is fair and convenient for plaintiff and all defendants.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTIONS D-E IF APPLICABLE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">D. Transfer for Convenience</p>

  <p class="western c4">19. {<i>Insert responses from FORM 3C:7.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Venue not convenient elsewhere,” ch. 3-C, §2.6.5, p. 166.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">E. Need for Continuance</p>

  <p class="western c4">20. Plaintiff asks for an opportunity to conduct discovery and collect affidavits to justify {<i>his/her/its</i>} opposition to defendant’s motion to sever and transfer. As part of this response, plaintiff attaches an affidavit as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>}, in compliance with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 252, stating that plaintiff cannot present by affidavits facts essential to justify {<i>his/her/its</i>} opposition to the motion to sever and transfer without additional time to conduct discovery and seek additional affidavits. <i>See Montalvo v. Fourth Ct. of Appeals</i>, 917 S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex. 1995); <i>cf. City of La Grange v. McBee</i>, 923 S.W.2d 89, 90-91 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, writ denied) (motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 257). {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Continuance,” ch. 3-C, §2.10.3, p. 167.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">21. Plaintiff needs additional time to {<i>conduct discovery/secure affidavits</i>} on the venue issues. Specifically, plaintiff intends to {<i>send interrogatories to/send requests for admissions to/take the deposition of/get an affidavit from</i>} {<i>defendant/{name of other person}</i>} to establish that {<i>identify type of information sought</i>}. This information will be material to the issue of establishing proper venue because {<i>explain</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Description of necessary evidence,” ch. 5-D, §8.1, p. 256.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">22. Plaintiff was unable to secure this {<i>testimony/evidence</i>} earlier even though {<i>he/she/it</i>} diligently used the discovery process. {<i>Summarize discovery attempts demonstrating diligence. If known, state why discovery attempts did not secure evidence.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c5">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Diligence,” ch. 5-D, §8.3, p. 257.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">23. {<i>Add appropriate paragraphs 14-19 from FORM 5D:1.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">F. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c4">24. Venue is proper in this county as to this plaintiff because this plaintiff can {<i>establish that venue is proper in this county/satisfy the requirements for proper joinder</i>} independently of every other plaintiff.</p>

  <p class="western c3">G. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">25. For these reasons, plaintiff {<i>name</i>} asks the court to deny defendant’s motion to sever and transfer venue {<i>add if applicable: or, in the alternative, grant plaintiff’s request for a continuance to conduct additional discovery and collect affidavits</i>}.</p>
