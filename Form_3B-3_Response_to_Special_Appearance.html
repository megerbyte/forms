  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S SPECIAL APPEARANCE</p>

  <p class="western c3">Plaintiff asks the court to overrule defendant’s special appearance.</p>

  <p class="western c2">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c3">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c2">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c3">3. On {<i>date</i>}, defendant filed a special appearance and asked the court to dismiss plaintiff’s suit for lack of personal jurisdiction over defendant. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Special Appearance-Challenging Personal Jurisdiction,” ch. 3-B, p. 152.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">4. {<i>State other facts relevant to the response.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">5. Plaintiff attaches affidavits to this response to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c2">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 6-10</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">6. The court should overrule defendant’s special appearance because defendant waived {<i>his/her/its</i>} special appearance by {<i>explain how defendant waived special appearance, e.g., filing an answer before filing a special appearance</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Waiver of Special Appearance,” ch. 3-B, §3, p. 156.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">7. The court should overrule defendant’s special appearance because it was not made by a sworn motion and no affidavits verified its contents. The special appearance must be presented by a sworn motion. Tex. R. Civ. P. 120a(1); <i>Exito Elecs. Co. v. Trejo</i>, 142 S.W.3d 302, 307 (Tex. 2004). {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Verification,” ch. 3-B, §2.4, p. 156.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">8. The court should overrule defendant’s special appearance because plaintiff’s suit arose from and was related to defendant’s contacts with Texas; therefore, the court has specific jurisdiction over defendant. <i>National Indus. Sand Ass’n v. Gibson</i>, 897 S.W.2d 769, 774 (Tex. 1995); <i>Schlobohm v. Schapiro</i>, 784 S.W.2d 355, 358 (Tex. 1990). This suit involves {<i>state what the suit involves</i>}. The incident giving rise to this suit was a result of defendant’s {<i>list defendant’s contacts that played a part in the incident that resulted in the lawsuit</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Specific jurisdiction,” ch. 3-B, §5.4.1(1), p. 158.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. The court should overrule defendant’s special appearance because defendant had continuous and systematic contacts with Texas; therefore, the court has general jurisdiction over defendant. <i>Guardian Royal Exch. Assur., Ltd. v. English China Clays, P.L.C.</i>, 815 S.W.2d 223, 228 (Tex. 1991); <i>Schlobohm v. Schapiro</i>, 784 S.W.2d 355, 358 (Tex. 1990). Defendant has {<i>list substantial contacts defendant had with Texas, e.g., made regular sales to Texas companies, has a permanent office in Texas</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General jurisdiction,” ch. 3-B, §5.4.1(2), p. 159.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">10. The court’s assumption of jurisdiction over defendant will not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and will be consistent with the constitutional requirement of due process because {<i>specify why it is fair to assert jurisdiction over defendant, e.g., defendant has derived financial benefit from doing business in Texas and has enjoyed the protection of Texas laws</i>}. <i>See Guardian Royal Exch. Assur., Ltd. v. English China Clays, P.L.C.</i>, 815 S.W.2d 223, 232 (Tex. 1991); <i>Schlobohm v. Schapiro</i>, 784 S.W.2d 355, 359 (Tex. 1990). {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No issue of fair play,” ch. 3-B, §5.4.2, p. 159.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTION D IF IN RESPONSE TO SPECIAL APPEARANCE FORM 3B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">D. Amended Petition</p>

  <p class="western c3">11. In its special appearance, defendant alleged that plaintiff did not meet {<i>his/ her/its</i>} initial burden of pleading that defendant, a nonresident, purposefully established “minimum contacts” with the State of Texas. Plaintiff attaches an amended original petition as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>}. No leave is required because this amendment is filed more than seven days before trial. Tex. R. Civ. P. 63. In the amended original petition, plaintiff includes specific allegations that defendant, a nonresident, “purposefully availed” {<i>himself/herself/itself</i>} of the privilege of conducting activities in Texas, and such contacts were sufficient to establish minimum contacts and give this court personal jurisdiction over defendant. {<i>Elaborate, showing how, when, and where the nonresident made itself subject to the jurisdiction of Texas courts.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Amend petition,” ch. 3-B, §5.1, p. 158.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>ADD SECTION E IF APPLICABLE</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">E. Need for Continuance</p>

  <p class="western c3">12. Plaintiff asks for an opportunity to conduct discovery and collect affidavits to justify {<i>his/her/its</i>} opposition to defendant’s special appearance. As part of this response, plaintiff attaches an affidavit as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>}, in compliance with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 120a(3), stating that plaintiff cannot present by affidavits facts essential to justify {<i>his/her/its</i>} opposition to the motion to dismiss without additional time to conduct discovery and seek additional affidavits. Based on the affidavit, the court should grant plaintiff additional time to respond to the special appearance. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Continuance,” ch. 3-B, §7, p. 159.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 13</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">13. Plaintiff intends to {<i>take the deposition of/secure an affidavit from</i>} {<i>name</i>}, whose address is {<i>address</i>}. By the {<i>deposition/affidavit</i>}, plaintiff intends to show {<i>state facts plaintiff intends to prove</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Description of necessary evidence,” ch. 5-D, §8.1, p. 256.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">13. Plaintiff intends to {<i>describe other form of discovery</i>}. By the {<i>describe form of discovery</i>} plaintiff intends to show {<i>state facts plaintiff intends to prove</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Description of necessary evidence,” ch. 5-D, §8.1, p. 256.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">14. The information plaintiff seeks is material to the issue of {<i>identify issue relating to the special appearance</i>} because {<i>state why</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Materiality,” ch. 5-D, §8.2, p. 257.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">15. Plaintiff was unable to secure this {<i>testimony/evidence</i>} earlier even though {<i>he/she/it</i>} diligently used the discovery process. {<i>Summarize discovery attempts demonstrating diligence. If known, state why discovery attempts did not secure evidence.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Diligence,” ch. 5-D, §8.3, p. 257.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">16. {<i>Add appropriate paragraphs 14-19 from FORM 5D:1.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">F. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c3">17. Because defendant’s contacts with Texas constitute “minimum contacts” with the State of Texas, the court’s assumption of jurisdiction over defendant will not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</p>

  <p class="western c2">G. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c3">18. For these reasons, plaintiff asks the court to overrule defendant’s special appearance {<i>add if applicable: or, in the alternative, grant plaintiff’s request for a continuance to conduct additional discovery and collect affidavits</i>}.</p>
