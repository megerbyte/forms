  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c2">{</span><i class="c3">PARTY</i><span class="c2">}’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY OPPOSING COUNSEL</span></p>

  <p class="western c4">{<i>Party</i>} asks the court to disqualify opposing counsel, {<i>name</i>}, from further representation of {<i>adverse party</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c4">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">3. This case is set for {<i>trial/hearing</i>} on {<i>date</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c4">4. {<i>State facts relevant to the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">5. {<i>Party</i>} attaches affidavits to this motion to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c5">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 6</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. A lawyer or law firm cannot represent a party in a matter adverse to a former client-unless the client consents-if the matter is “substantially related” to the earlier representation. Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Conduct 1.09(a); <i>In re Epic Holdings, Inc.</i>, 985 S.W.2d 41, 43 (Tex. 1998); <i>Texaco, Inc. v. Garcia</i>, 891 S.W.2d 255, 256 (Tex. 1995). The substantial relationship test requires proof that the facts of the earlier representation are so related to the facts in the pending litigation that there is a genuine threat that confidences revealed to former counsel will be divulged to a present adversary. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Syntek Fin. Corp.</i>, 881 S.W.2d 319, 320-21 (Tex. 1994). {<i>See</i> <i class="c6">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Lawyer represented other party,” ch. 1-H, §8.2.2, p. 45.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. A firm must be disqualified if a partner or associate of the firm previously represented an adverse party in a matter “substantially related” to the pending litigation. <i>See Texaco, Inc. v. Garcia</i>, 891 S.W.2d 255, 256-57 (Tex. 1995); <i>Henderson v. Floyd</i>, 891 S.W.2d 252, 253-54 (Tex. 1995). The substantial relationship test requires proof that the facts of the earlier representation are so related to the facts in the pending litigation that there is a genuine threat that confidences revealed to former counsel will be divulged to a present adversary. <i>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Syntek Fin. Corp.</i>, 881 S.W.2d 319, 320-21 (Tex. 1994). {<i>See</i> <i class="c6">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Lawyer represented other party,” ch. 1-H, §8.2.2(1)-(2), p. 45.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. A firm must be disqualified if one of its employees who works on the lawsuit previously worked on the same lawsuit at another firm representing the adversary. <i>See In re American Home Prods. Corp.</i>, 985 S.W.2d 68, 74 (Tex. 1998); <i>Grant v. Thirteenth Ct. of Appeals</i>, 888 S.W.2d 466, 467-68 (Tex. 1994). There is a conclusive presumption that confidences were revealed during the course of the employee’s prior employment. <i>See Phoenix Founders, Inc. v. Marshall</i>, 887 S.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex. 1994). {<i>See</i> <i class="c6">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Nonlawyer employee,” ch. 1-H, §8.2.2(3), p. 45.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">6. If a lawyer becomes a witness, the lawyer is disqualified to act as a lawyer in the case. <i>Mauze v. Curry</i>, 861 S.W.2d 869, 870 (Tex. 1993). When a lawyer’s testimony may be necessary to establish an essential fact on its client’s behalf, the court should disqualify the lawyer. <i>See In re Bahn</i>, 13 S.W.3d 865, 874 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2000, orig. proceeding); <i>Warrilow v. Norrell</i>, 791 S.W.2d 515, 523 n.10 (Tex. App.— Corpus Christi 1989, writ denied). If the lawyer’s role as both an advocate and a witness will cause the opposing party actual prejudice, the court should disqualify the lawyer. <i>In re Sanders</i>, 153 S.W.3d 54, 57 (Tex. 2004); <i>Ayres v. Canales</i>, 790 S.W.2d 554, 558 (Tex. 1990). {<i>See</i> <i class="c6">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Lawyer as witness,” ch. 1-H, §8.2.5, p. 46.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 7</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Opposing counsel personally represented {<i>party</i>} in a case involving a matter factually related to this case. {<i>State facts of earlier representation and identify facts that establish a substantial relationship between the earlier matter and the pending litigation, e.g., similar defenses, similar scientific issues, similar liability issues, similar strategies.</i>} There is, therefore, a genuine threat that {<i>party</i>}’s former confidences will be divulged to {<i>adverse party</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. {<i>Name</i>}, a {<i>partner/associate</i>} in opposing counsel’s firm, represented {<i>party</i>} in a matter factually related to this proceeding. {<i>State facts of earlier representation and identify facts that establish a substantial relationship between the earlier matter and the pending litigation, e.g., similar defenses, similar scientific issues, similar liability issues, similar strategies.</i>} There is, therefore, a genuine threat that {<i>party</i>}’s former confidences will be divulged to {<i>adverse party</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. {<i>Name</i>} is an employee of opposing counsel’s firm and previously worked on this case for the firm of {<i>party</i>}’s counsel. {<i>State the facts of earlier employment and former employee’s contact with the case.</i>} There is, therefore, a genuine threat that {<i>party</i>}’s former confidences will be divulged to {<i>adverse party</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c4">7. Opposing counsel has personal knowledge of essential facts and may be called as a witness. {<i>Identify facts supporting the necessity of the testimony and that the testimony will not concern uncontested facts, formalities, or legal fees.</i>} Opposing counsel’s role as both an advocate and a witness will cause {<i>party</i>} actual prejudice. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} The court, therefore, should disqualify opposing counsel from further representation in this case.</p>

  <p class="western c5">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c4">8. {<i>Briefly summarize the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c4">9. For these reasons, {<i>party</i>} asks the court, after a hearing on the motion, to disqualify opposing counsel from further participation in this case.</p>
