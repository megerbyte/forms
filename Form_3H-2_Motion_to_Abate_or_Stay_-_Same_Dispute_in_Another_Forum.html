  <p class="western c1">Form 3H:2 Motion to Abate or Stay - Same Dispute in Another Forum</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c2">DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO {</span><i class="c3">ABATE/STAY</i><span class="c2">}</span></p>

  <p class="western c5">Defendant asks the court to {<i>abate/stay</i>} the proceedings pending in {<i>current</i>} County. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Types of Motions to Abate,” ch. 3-H, §§3.2-3.6, pp. 207-08.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c5">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">3. Because the dispute is already pending in another forum, the court should {<i>abate/stay</i>} this suit.</p>

  <p class="western c6">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 4</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. Defendant sued plaintiff for {<i>state basis of suit</i>} in {<i>identify other forum</i>} on {<i>date</i>}, styled {<i>identify cause number</i>}. Attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} is a copy of defendant’s petition in that suit. The two lawsuits involve the same parties and the same issues. {<i>Elaborate.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. An administrative proceeding was begun in {<i>identify other forum</i>}, by {<i>name of administrative agency</i>}, on {<i>date</i>}, under {<i>identify statute under which administrative proceeding was commenced</i>}, and designated as {<i>identify proceeding number</i>}. Attached as Exhibit {<i>letter</i>} is a copy of {<i>identify document from agency, e.g., complaint, request, notice</i>}. The administrative proceeding and this lawsuit involve the same parties and the same issues. {<i>Elaborate.</i>} The dispute before the {<i>name of administrative agency</i>} involves the resolution of issues within that agency’s special competence.</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. Thus, this dispute is already pending in {<i>{other} County/federal court/ another state’s court/an administrative proceeding</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. {<i>State other facts relevant to the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. Defendant attaches affidavits to this motion to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c6">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 8</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. The court should abate this lawsuit because the same suit involving the same parties and issues was first filed in {<i>other</i>} County, and that court has dominant jurisdiction. When the subject matter of the two suits is inherently interrelated, the court where the second suit was filed must grant a motion to abate. <i>Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co.</i>, 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988); <i>Curtis v. Gibbs</i>, 511 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex. 1974); <i>Sweezy Constr., Inc. v. Murray</i>, 915 S.W.2d 527, 531 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1995, orig. proceeding). It is not necessary that the exact issues and all the parties be included in the first action before the second is filed, provided that the claim in the first suit may be amended to bring in all necessary and proper issues and parties. <i>Wyatt</i>, 760 S.W.2d at 247<i>.</i> To demonstrate it is entitled to an abatement, the party filing the motion must allege and prove the other suit (1) was commenced first and citation has been served, (2) is still pending, (3) involves the same parties, and (4) involves the same controversies. <i>See In re Sims</i>, 88 S.W.3d 297, 303 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, orig. proceeding). {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>,</i> <i>“Abate - same dispute in another Texas court,” ch. 3-H, §3.2, p. 207.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. The court should stay this lawsuit because a suit involving the same parties and issues was first filed in federal court. Although the mere pendency of a suit in federal court involving the same parties and issues is not a reason to abate the later-filed state court suit, the court should grant the motion to stay the state court action when the subject matter of the two suits is inherently interrelated. <i>See Taiwan Shrimp Farm Village Ass’n v. U.S.A. Shrimp Farm Dev., Inc.</i>, 915 S.W.2d 61, 68 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1996, writ denied); <i>Space Master Int’l, Inc. v. Porta-Kamp Mfg. Co.</i>, 794 S.W.2d 944, 946 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ); <i>Williamson v. Tucker</i>, 615 S.W.2d 881, 885-86 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Because the federal suit was filed first, and the subject matter of the two suits is inherently interrelated, the court should stay this proceeding until the federal cause of action is resolved. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Stay - same dispute in federal court,” ch. 3-H, §3.6, p. 208.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. The court should stay this lawsuit because a suit involving the same parties and issues was first filed in the State of {<i>other state</i>}. Although the mere pendency of a suit in another state’s court involving the same parties and subject matter is not a reason to abate the later-filed state court suit, the court should grant the motion to stay the state court action when the subject matter of the two suits is inherently interrelated. <i>See</i> <i>Space Master Int’l, Inc. v. Porta-Kamp Mfg. Co.</i>, 794 S.W.2d 944, 946 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ); <i>see also VE Corp. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i>, 860 S.W.2d 83, 84 (Tex. 1993) (principals of comity generally require the second suit be abated). Because plaintiff first sued defendant in {<i>other state</i>}, the court should stay this proceeding until the {<i>other state</i>} cause of action is resolved. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Stay - same dispute in another state’s court,” ch. 3-H, §3.5, p. 208.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. The court should abate this lawsuit because the same dispute is pending in an administrative hearing before {<i>name of administrative agency</i>}. Under {<i>identify statute</i>}, the {<i>name of administrative agency</i>} has concurrent jurisdiction with the courts over this dispute. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires this court to abate this suit until the {<i>name of administrative agency</i>} hears the dispute or makes specific findings. <i>Subaru, Inc. v. David McDavid Nissan, Inc.</i>, 84 S.W.3d 212, 221 (Tex. 2002). Only after the agency has heard the dispute may the dispute be submitted to the courts. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Meekey v. Rick’s Cabaret, Int’l, Inc.</i>, 171 S.W.3d 394, 399 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied). This court should defer to {<i>name of administrative agency</i>} because it is adjudicating a dispute that requires resolving issues within its special competence. <i>See Subaru</i>, 84 S.W.3d at 221<i>.</i> {<i>Elaborate.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Abate - administrative agency has primary jurisdiction,” ch. 3-H, §3.4, p. 208.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">9. {<i>Elaborate on argument, applying the facts to the law.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c5">10. Because plaintiff first sued defendant in {<i>identify other forum</i>} and alleged the same causes of action, the {<i>identify other forum</i>} acquired dominant jurisdiction. Therefore, the court should {<i>abate/stay</i>} the suit pending before it.</p>

  <p class="western c6">E. Request for Hearing</p>

  <p class="western c5">11. Defendant asks the court to set this motion for an evidentiary hearing at the earliest practical time. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Hearing,” ch. 3-H, §5, p. 209.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">F. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c5">12. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set this motion to {<i>abate/stay</i>} for hearing and, after the hearing, grant defendant’s motion to {<i>abate/stay</i>}.</p>
