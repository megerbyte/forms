  <p class="western c1"><span class="c2">{</span><i class="c3">PARTY</i><span class="c2">}’S MOTION IN LIMINE</span></p>

  <p class="western c5">Before the voir dire examination of the jury panel, and out of the presence and hearing of the jury panel, {<i>party</i>}, {<i>name</i>}, makes this motion in limine. {<i>Party</i>} seeks to exclude matters that are inadmissible, irrelevant, or prejudicial in this case. If {<i>adverse party</i>}, {<i>name</i>}, injects these matters into the trial of this case through a party, an attorney, or a witness, it will cause irreparable harm to {<i>party</i>}’s case, which no jury instruction could cure. If any of these matters are brought to the attention of the jury, directly or indirectly, {<i>party</i>} would be compelled to move for a mistrial. In an effort to avoid prejudice and a mistrial, {<i>party</i>} urges this motion in limine. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Motion,” ch. 5-E, §2, p. 265.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">{<i>Party</i>} asks the court to instruct {<i>adverse party</i>} and all counsel not to mention, refer to, interrogate about, or attempt to convey to the jury in any manner, either directly or indirectly, any of the matters listed below without first obtaining a ruling from the court outside the presence and hearing of the jury, and to instruct {<i>adverse party</i>} and all counsel to warn and caution each witness to follow the same instructions.</p>

  <p class="western c6">A. Grounds</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 1-64</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>Grounds for either party</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">1. Any witness {<i>adverse party</i>} did not name in response to requests for disclosures or interrogatories, or any evidence requested by {<i>party</i>} but not produced by {<i>adverse party</i>}. <i>See Gee v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co.</i>, 765 S.W.2d 394, 395 (Tex. 1989).</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. Any testimony or arguments that contradict {<i>adverse party</i>}’s deemed admissions. <i>See Marshall v. Vise</i>, 767 S.W.2d 699, 700 (Tex. 1989).</p>

  <p class="western c5">3. Any testimony or argument suggesting {<i>party</i>} asserted claims of privilege during discovery. Claims of privilege are not admissible as evidence. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 513(a), (b).</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. Any attempt to elicit testimony from {<i>party</i>} about communications with {<i>his/her/its</i>} attorneys. Such communications are privileged. Tex. R. Evid. 503.</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. Any attempt in the presence of the jury to ask {<i>party</i>}’s attorneys to produce documents, stipulate to any fact, or make any agreement.</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. Any testimony by {<i>adverse party</i>}’s expert concerning {<i>his/her</i>} discussions with another expert. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 801, 802; <i>Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp.</i>, 747 S.W.2d 361, 365 (Tex. 1987).</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. Any evidence {<i>party</i>}’s expert was represented by {<i>party</i>}’s counsel in a past lawsuit. Such evidence is not admissible for impeachment purposes. <i>See Stam v. Mack</i>, 984 S.W.2d 747, 751 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, no pet.); <i>Watson v. Isern</i>, 782 S.W.2d 546, 549 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1989, writ denied).</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. Any mention {<i>party</i>} is an atheist. Evidence of religious beliefs of a witness is not admissible to enhance or impair credibility. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 610.</p>

  <p class="western c5">9. Any mention that any party or witness goes to church every Sunday and tithes or does not go to church and does not tithe. Evidence of religious beliefs of a witness is not admissible to enhance or impair credibility. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 610.</p>

  <p class="western c5">10. Any mention {<i>party</i>} often {<i>describe conduct</i>}. Even though evidence of a habit may be admissible to prove that a party’s conduct on a particular occasion conformed with the habit or routine practice, evidence of past conduct that does not rise to the level of habit is inadmissible. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 406, 608(b);<i>Magro v. Ragsdale Bros.</i>, 721 S.W.2d 832, 834 (Tex. 1986).</p>

  <p class="western c5">11. Any mention {<i>party</i>} drinks or spends excessively on the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Intoxication is not an issue in this trial, and this evidence would unduly prejudice the jury against {<i>party</i>}. <i>See McCarty v. Gappelberg</i>, 273 S.W.2d 943, 945 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1954, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">12. Any mention {<i>party</i>} received a dishonorable discharge from the military.</p>

  <p class="western c5">13. Any mention {<i>party</i>} has not filed income tax returns. <i>See Wilkins v. Royal Indem. Co.</i>, 592 S.W.2d 64, 67-68 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1979, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">14. Any mention that any party or witness is rich or poor, which is not relevant and is prejudicial. <i>See Wilmoth v. Limestone Prods. Co.</i>, 255 S.W.2d 532, 534 (Tex. App.—Waco 1953, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">15. Any mention of the value of {<i>party</i>}’s assets, which can be an indicator of wealth, is irrelevant and prejudicial. <i>See First Nat’l Bank v. Beavers</i>, 619 S.W.2d 288, 289-90 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">16. Any mention {<i>party</i>} {<i>did not receive/received/paid</i>} a traffic ticket. <i>See Isaacs v. Plains Transp. Co.</i>, 367 S.W.2d 152, 153 (Tex. 1963); <i>Condra Funeral Home v. Rollin</i>, 314 S.W.2d 277, 282 (Tex. 1958).</p>

  <p class="western c5">17. Any mention {<i>party</i>} was convicted of misdemeanor DWI. Evidence of criminal convictions is admissible for impeachment only if the crime was a felony or involved moral turpitude, and the trial court rules that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect. Tex. R. Evid. 609(a); <i>see Ramirez v. Wood</i>, 577 S.W.2d 278, 290 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1978, no writ). A conviction for misdemeanor DWI does not involve moral turpitude. <i>Shipman v. State</i>, 604 S.W.2d 182, 184 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980).</p>

  <p class="western c5">18. Any mention of a statement made by {<i>party</i>} during plea negotiations that did not result in a plea of guilty, or resulted in a guilty plea that was later withdrawn. Tex. R. Evid. 410.</p>

  <p class="western c5">19. Any mention {<i>adverse</i> <i>party</i>} received a purple heart from the military.</p>

  <p class="western c5">20. Any mention {<i>party</i>}’s witness is a resident alien and is about to be deported. <i>See Plyler v. Doe</i>, 457 U.S. 202, 215 (1982) (illegal aliens are covered by the 14th amendment and must be treated equally with citizens).</p>

  <p class="western c5">21. Any mention, by reference to title or otherwise, that the witness, {<i>name</i>}, who will be called by {<i>adverse party</i>}, {<i>is/was</i>} a judge. The jury should not be influenced by {<i>name</i>}’s {<i>present/former</i>} status as a judge, which would increase the probative value of {<i>name</i>}’s testimony and unfairly prejudice the jury in {<i>adverse party</i>}’s favor. <i>Weiss v. Commission for Lawyer Discipline</i>, 981 S.W.2d 8, 22 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied).</p>

  <p class="western c5">22. Any mention of the probable testimony of a witness who is absent, unavailable, or not called or allowed to testify in this case.</p>

  <p class="western c5">23. Any testimony in violation of the Dead Man’s Statute. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 601(b); <i>see Cain v. Whitlock</i>, 741 S.W.2d 528, 530 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">24. Any comment by {<i>adverse party</i>}’s attorney that informs the jury of the effect of its answers to the questions in the charge. <i>See Magic Chef, Inc. v. Sibley</i>, 546 S.W.2d 851, 857 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1977, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">25. Before the court rules on the law applicable to this case, any statement of the law other than that regarding the burden of proof and the basic legal definitions counsel believes to be applicable.</p>

  <p class="western c5">26. Any mention of the letter from {<i>adverse party</i>}’s attorneys advising that {<i>party</i>}’s claim was a {<i>certain winner/loser</i>}. <i>See Beacon Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Reynolds</i>, 799 S.W.2d 390, 397 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1990, writ denied). Self-serving evidence generated by a party is inadmissible.</p>

  <p class="western c5">27. Any mention of a regulatory measure, which is not admissible without a showing of both its application to the situation in question and a clear violation of the regulation. <i>See Mottu v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp.</i>, 804 S.W.2d 144, 146-47 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, writ denied).</p>

  <p class="western c5">28. Any mention the parties engaged in settlement negotiations. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 408; <i>Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp.</i>, 747 S.W.2d 361, 365 (Tex. 1987).</p>

  <p class="western c5">29. Any mention of any statement made by {<i>party</i>} during settlement negotiations. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 408; <i>Ochs v. Martinez</i>, 789 S.W.2d 949, 959-60 (Tex. App.— San Antonio 1990, writ denied).</p>

  <p class="western c5">30. Any mention {<i>party</i>} {<i>is/was</i>} involved in other suits. <i>See Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp.</i>, 747 S.W.2d 361, 365 (Tex. 1987).</p>

  <p class="western c5">31. Any mention that an award of damages will affect insurance premiums, the price of any goods or services, or the level of taxation.</p>

  <p class="western c5">32. Any mention that the jurors should put themselves in the position of the {<i>adverse</i> <i>party</i>}. <i>MAPCO, Inc. v. Farrington</i>, 476 S.W.2d 50, 53-54 (Tex. App.— Amarillo 1971, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">33. Any mention from {<i>adverse party</i>}’s attorney regarding {<i>his/her</i>} personal opinion about the credibility of any witness. <i>See Menefee v. State</i>, 614 S.W.2d 167, 168 (Tex. Crim. App. 1981).</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>Grounds for plaintiff</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">34. Any attempt to elicit testimony or introduce records from plaintiff’s {<i>physician/psychologist</i>} concerning plaintiff’s mental or emotional health. Such communications are privileged because plaintiff’s mental and emotional health does not relate in a significant way to {<i>his/her</i>} claim. Tex. R. Evid. 509, 510; <i>R.K. v. Ramirez</i>, 887 S.W.2d 836, 843 (Tex. 1994).</p>

  <p class="western c5">35. Any testimony or argument suggesting plaintiff’s attorney has a contingency fee in the suit. <i>See Azar Nut Co. v. Caille</i>, 720 S.W.2d 685, 688 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1986), <i>aff’d</i>, 734 S.W.2d 667 (Tex. 1987).</p>

  <p class="western c5">36. Any photographs of plaintiff exercising strenuously after the accident, which were obtained by defendant’s investigator in violation of Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 4.02. <i>See Barham v. Turner Constr. Co.</i>, 803 S.W.2d 731, 739 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1990, writ denied). Plaintiff contends defendant’s attorney instructed {<i>his/her</i>} investigator, in violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, to contact plaintiff, befriend {<i>him/her</i>}, and invite {<i>him/her</i>} to exercise strenuously. If the court overrules this matter, plaintiff requests the opportunity to make a record on this issue and examine defendant’s attorney and {<i>his/her/ its</i>} investigator.</p>

  <p class="western c5">37. Any mention plaintiff received benefits under the provisions of {<i>his/her</i>} uninsured motorist policy. <i>See Allen v. Avery</i>, 537 S.W.2d 789, 791 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1976, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">38. Any mention plaintiff received health and accident or disability insurance. <i>See Lee-Wright, Inc. v. Hall</i>, 840 S.W.2d 572, 581-82 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">39. Any mention plaintiff received retirement benefits. <i>See Azar Nut Co. v. Caille</i>, 720 S.W.2d 685, 688 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1986), <i>aff’d</i>, 734 S.W.2d 667 (Tex. 1987).</p>

  <p class="western c5">40. Any mention plaintiff received unemployment benefits. <i>See Century Papers, Inc. v. Perrino</i>, 551 S.W.2d 507, 511 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1977, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">41. Any mention plaintiff received social security disability payments. <i>See Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co. v. Reed</i>, 376 S.W.2d 591, 593 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1964, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">42. Any mention plaintiff received veteran’s benefits. <i>See Montandon v. Colehour</i>, 469 S.W.2d 222, 229-30 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1971, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">44. Any mention plaintiff received contributions from family, friends, or {<i>his/ her</i>} employer.</p>

  <p class="western c5">45. Any mention plaintiff received benefits from sick leave or vacation time.</p>

  <p class="western c5">46. Any mention plaintiff, the surviving spouse in a death case, {<i>had an extramarital relationship/is married under the common law/is engaged to marry a millionaire</i>}. <i>See</i> Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code §71.005; <i>Exxon Corp. v. Brecheen</i>, 526 S.W.2d 519, 525 (Tex. 1975).</p>

  <p class="western c5">47. Any mention of the financial consequences of plaintiff’s remarriage. <i>See Richardson v. Holmes</i>, 525 S.W.2d 293, 299 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c5">48. Any mention plaintiff’s recovery will not be subject to taxation. <i>See Turner v. General Motors Corp.</i>, 584 S.W.2d 844, 853 (Tex. 1979).</p>

  <p class="western c5">49. Any testimony or argument suggesting plaintiff {<i>should have pursued/did not pursue</i>} any remedy or remedies authorized by the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act. <i>See Brown v. Hopkins</i>, 921 S.W.2d 306, 318 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1996, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">50. Any reference to collateral sources, including group medical insurance benefits. <i>See Kendrix v. Southern Pac. Transp. Co.</i>, 907 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1995, writ denied); <i>Dove v. Director, State Employees Workers’ Comp. Div.</i>, 857 S.W.2d 577, 578-79 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied).</p>

  <p class="western c5">51. Any mention of plaintiff’s claim against {<i>name</i>}. Evidence of another claim to show plaintiff is a professional litigant is improper. <i>See Employers Cas. Co. v. Peterson</i>, 609 S.W.2d 579, 585 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1980, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">52. Any mention an insurance company owns a portion of plaintiff’s claim.</p>

  <p class="western c5">53. Any testimony or evidence regarding injuries plaintiff suffered before the injuries that are the subject of this suit. <i>McClintock v. Travelers Ins. Co.</i>, 393 S.W.2d 421, 424 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.).</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>Grounds for defendant</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">54. Any reference to minutes of a hospital section meeting, which are privileged under Texas Health &amp; Safety Code sections 161.031-161.033. <i>See Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp.</i>, 747 S.W.2d 361, 365-66 (Tex. 1987).</p>

  <p class="western c5">55. Any comment that attempts to impose liability upon or arouse prejudice against defendant simply because it is a corporation.</p>

  <p class="western c5">56. Any comment or reference to defendant corporation as “foreign” or “alien” or any similar comment that may draw upon the prejudices of the jury toward defendant corporation’s home country. Such evidence is irrelevant, and its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>

  <p class="western c5">57. Any comment to the jury that the court can reduce the amount of the jury’s award.</p>

  <p class="western c5">58. Any comment regarding who pays the damages, or whether defendant will pay the damages.</p>

  <p class="western c5">59. Any mention that defendant is covered by liability insurance. Tex. R. Evid. 411; <i>see Rojas v. Vuocolo</i>, 177 S.W.2d 962, 964 (Tex. 1944); <i>Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry. v. Acosta</i>, 435 S.W.2d 539, 549 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1968, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Referring to a witness as an “adjuster” introduces insurance into the case. <i>See Acosta</i>, 435 S.W.2d at 549.</p>

  <p class="western c5">60. Any mention that plaintiff’s collateral compensation was reduced. For example, the loss of Social Security benefits by a widow and child is not admissible as evidence that they are entitled to a larger damage award. <i>See McLemore v. Broussard</i>, 670 S.W.2d 301, 303 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1983, no writ).</p>

  <p class="western c5">61. Any mention of post-accident changes. Evidence of post-accident changes is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in a product or its design, or a need for a warning or instruction. Tex. R. Evid. 407(a).</p>

  <p class="western c5">62. Any comment or reference of other criminal activity which took place at defendant’s other {<i>identify premises, e.g., apartment houses, stores</i>}. Merely because crimes have occurred at {<i>identify premises, e.g., an apartment house, a store</i>} in a high-crime area does not make it more likely that crimes will occur at another {<i>identify premises, e.g., apartment house, store</i>} in another area. For a risk to be foreseeable, there must be evidence of criminal activity within the specific area at issue, either on the landowner’s property or in close proximity. <i>Timberwalk Apts. v. Cain</i>, 972 S.W.2d 749, 757 (Tex. 1998). The factors of proximity, recency, frequency, similarity, and publicity must be considered in determining whether criminal conduct was foreseeable. <i>Id.</i> at 759. Those factors are not present in this case.</p>

  <p class="western c5">63. Any comment or reference of unreported criminal activity at defendant’s other {<i>identify premises, e.g., apartment houses, stores</i>}. <i>Timberwalk Apts. v. Cain</i>, 972 S.W.2d 749, 757 (Tex. 1998). Unreported criminal activity on the premises is not evidence of foreseeability. Previous similar incidents cannot make future crime foreseeable if nobody knew or should have known that those incidents occurred. <i>Id.</i></p>

  <p class="western c5">64. Any mention defendant paid or made offers to pay any medical expenses of plaintiff. <i>See</i> Tex. R. Evid. 408, 409.</p>

  <p class="western c6">B. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c5">65. For these reasons, {<i>party</i>} asks the court to instruct {<i>adverse party</i>} and {<i>his/her/its</i>} counsel and witnesses not to mention, refer to, interrogate about, or attempt to convey to the jury in any manner, either directly or indirectly, any of the matters listed above without first obtaining a ruling from the court outside the presence and hearing of the jury.</p>
