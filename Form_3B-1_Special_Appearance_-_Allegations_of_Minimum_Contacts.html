  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">DEFENDANT’S SPECIAL APPEARANCE</p>

  <p class="western c3">Defendant asks the court to sustain {<i>his/her/its</i>} special appearance and dismiss plaintiff’s suit.</p>

  <p class="western c2">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c3">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c3">2. Plaintiff sued defendant for {<i>state basis of suit</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c2">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c3">3. Defendant is not a resident of the State of Texas and has had no purposeful contacts with this state. Defendant is {<i>an individual/a corporation</i>} and does not {<i>reside/do business</i>} in Texas. Defendant {<i>resides/does business</i>} in {<i>identify state</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Special Appearance-Challenging Personal Jurisdiction,” ch. 3-B, p. 152.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">4. {<i>State other facts relevant to the special appearance.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">5. Defendant attaches affidavits to this special appearance to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c2">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c3">6. Texas courts do not have jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant unless the nonresident defendant has purposefully established “minimum contacts” with Texas, and the court’s exercise of jurisdiction over defendant comports with “fair play and substantial justice.” <i>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz</i>, 471 U.S. 462, 474-76 (1985); <i>BMC Software Belg. v. Marchand</i>, 83 S.W.3d 789, 795 (Tex. 2002); <i>Guardian Royal Exch. Assur., Ltd. v. English China Clays, P.L.C.</i>, 815 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex. 1991).</p>

  <p class="western c2">No Minimum Contacts</p>

  <p class="western c3">7. Under minimum contacts analysis, Texas courts must determine whether the nonresident defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within Texas. <i>Michiana Easy Livin’ Country, Inc. v. Holten</i>, 168 S.W.3d 777, 784-85 (Tex. 2005); <i>Guardian Royal</i>, 815 S.W.2d at 226; <i>see CSR Ltd. v. Link</i>, 925 S.W.2d 591, 596 (Tex. 1996). Minimum contacts are not established unless the court finds it has either specific or general jurisdiction over the defendant. <i>See Commonwealth Gen. Corp. v. York</i>, 177 S.W.3d 923, 925 (Tex. 2005); <i>BMC Software</i>, 83 S.W.3d at 795. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “No minimum contacts,” ch. 3-B, §2.3.2, p. 153.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPHS 8-9</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">8. Texas courts cannot exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant unless the nonresident defendant’s activities were “purposefully directed” to Texas, and the litigation resulted from injuries that are alleged to “arise out of” or “relate to” those activities. <i>National Indus. Sand Ass’n v. Gibson</i>, 897 S.W.2d 769, 774 (Tex. 1995); <i>Schlobohm v. Schapiro</i>, 784 S.W.2d 355, 358 (Tex. 1990); <i>see Helicopteros Nacionales v. Hall</i>, 466 U.S. 408, 414 (1984); <i>BMC Software</i>, 83 S.W.3d at 796. Texas courts do not have specific jurisdiction over defendant because defendant did not purposefully direct {<i>his/her/its</i>} activities to Texas, and plaintiff’s cause of action did not arise from or relate to defendant’s contacts with Texas. Rather, plaintiff’s cause of action arose from {<i>state how action arose and why defendant had no purposeful contacts with Texas that give rise to specific jurisdiction</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Specific jurisdiction,” ch. 3-B, §2.3.2(1), p. 153.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c3">9. Texas courts cannot exercise general jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant unless the nonresident defendant has continuous and systematic contacts with Texas. <i>BMC Software</i>, 83 S.W.3d at 796; <i>Guardian Royal</i>, 815 S.W.2d at 230; <i>see</i> <i>Helicopteros Nacionales v. Hall</i>, 466 U.S. 408, 415-16 (1984). Texas courts do not have general jurisdiction over defendant because defendant has not had continuous or systematic contacts with Texas. {<i>If defendant had contacts with Texas, identify the contacts and explain why they are neither systematic nor continuous. If defendant had no contacts with Texas, describe the lack of contacts with Texas, e.g., defendant has not traveled to Texas, defendant has no place of business in Texas, defendant has not taken any other action that would put defendant on notice that defendant is subject to the call of a Texas court.</i>} {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “General jurisdiction,” ch. 3-B, §2.3.2(2), p. 154.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">Fair Play &amp; Due Process</p>

  <p class="western c3">10. This court’s assumption of jurisdiction over the defendant and {<i>his/her/its</i>} property will offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and will be inconsistent with the constitutional requirements of due process. <i>See International Shoe Co. v. Washington</i>, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945); <i>Guardian Royal</i>, 815 S.W.2d at 231. The court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over defendant because {<i>state how notions of fair play and substantial justice would be offended, analyzing each of the following factors: (1) the burden on defendant, (2) the interests of the forum state in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4) the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and (5) the shared interest of the states in furthering fundamental social policies</i>}. <i>Guardian Royal</i>, 815 S.W.2d at 231. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Exercise of jurisdiction unfair,” ch. 3-B, §2.3.3, p. 156.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c2">D. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c3">11. Defendant does not have the minimum contacts with the State of Texas to justify a Texas court’s assumption of jurisdiction. If this court assumes jurisdiction over defendant, it will offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</p>

  <p class="western c2">E. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c3">12. For these reasons, defendant asks the court to set {<i>his/her/its</i>} special appearance for hearing and, after the hearing, sustain defendant’s special appearance and enter a final judgment dismissing plaintiff’s cause of action. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Request hearing,” ch. 3-B, §2.6, p. 156.</i>}</p>
