  <p class="western c1">{<i>STYLE OF THE CASE - FORM 1B:2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c1"><span class="c2">{</span><i class="c3">PARTY</i><span class="c2">}’S MOTION TO RECUSE</span></p>

  <p class="western c5">{<i>Party</i>} asks the judge of the court to recuse {<i>himself/herself</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Motion to Recuse or Disqualify,” ch. 5-C, §4, p. 249.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">A. Introduction</p>

  <p class="western c5">1. Plaintiff is {<i>name</i>}; defendant is {<i>name</i>}.</p>

  <p class="western c6">B. Facts</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE PARAGRAPH 2</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. {<i>Party</i>} files this motion at least ten days before this case is set for {<i>trial/ {identify other proceeding}</i>}. {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Deadline to file,” ch. 5-C, §4.3, p. 250.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">2. {<i>Party</i>} files this motion less than ten days before this case is set for {<i>trial/ {identify other proceeding}</i>}. {<i>Explain, e.g., party discovered judge’s personal bias seven days before case was set for trial and immediately filed its recusal motion.</i>}{<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Late motion to recuse,” ch. 5-C, §4.3.1, p. 250.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">3. {<i>State other facts relevant to the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">4. {<i>Party</i>} attaches affidavits to this motion to establish facts not apparent from the record and incorporates them by reference.</p>

  <p class="western c6">C. Argument &amp; Authorities</p>

  <p class="western c5">5. The due process clauses of both the Texas and the United States Constitutions guarantee a party an impartial and disinterested tribunal in civil cases. <i>Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc.</i>, 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980); <i>Metzger v. Sebek</i>, 892 S.W.2d 20, 37-38 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied).</p>

  <p class="western c5">6. {<i>Party</i>} will be deprived of a fair trial in violation of the due process clauses of both the state and federal constitutions and Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b because</p>

  <p class="western c1">{<i>CHOOSE APPROPRIATE GROUNDS</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(A) the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(a); <i>Woodruff v. Wright</i>, 51 S.W.3d 727, 735-36 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2001, pet. denied). The inquiry the court must make is whether a reasonable member of the public, knowing all the facts in the public domain, would have a reasonable doubt that a judge is actually impartial. <i>Sears v. Olivarez</i>, 28 S.W.3d 611, 613 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.); <i>see also Woodruff</i>, 51 S.W.3d at 736 (reasonable person standard). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Impartiality might be questioned,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.1, p. 109.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(B) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice against {<i>the subject matter of the case/a party</i>}. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(b); <i>Wright v. Wright</i>, 867 S.W.2d 807, 811 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1993, writ denied); <i>see, e.g.</i>, <i>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie</i>, 475 U.S. 813, 821-22 (1986) (judge was biased because success of judge’s own suit before lower court depended on ruling in case before judge). The judge’s bias is extra-judicial and is not based on in-court rulings. <i>In re M.C.M.</i>, 57 S.W.3d 27, 33 (Tex. App.— Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Bias &amp; prejudice,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.2, p. 109.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(C) the judge has personal knowledge of a disputed fact in this suit. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(b). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Judge has personal knowledge,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.3, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(D) {<i>the judge/an attorney with whom the judge previously practiced law</i>} has been a material witness concerning this proceeding. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(c). {<i>Identify proceeding and describe role as witness.</i>} {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Material witness,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.4, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(E) the judge, while acting as an attorney in government service, {<i>participated as counsel, adviser, or material witness in/expressed an opinion regarding the merits of</i>} the controversy. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(d). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Judge expressed an opinion,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.5, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(F) the judge knows that {<i>he/she</i>}, as {<i>an individual/a fiduciary</i>}, has {<i>a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy/a financial interest in a party to the proceeding/{identify other interest}</i>}, which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceedings. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(e). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Fiduciary interest,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.6, p. 110; “Financial interest,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.7, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(G) the judge knows that {<i>his wife/her husband/a minor child residing in the judge’s household</i>} has {<i>a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy/a financial interest in a party to the proceeding/{identify other interest}</i>}, which could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceedings. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(e). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Financial interest,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.7, p. 110; “Family’s fiduciary interest,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.8, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(H) the judge knows that {<i>he/she/his wife/her husband</i>} {<i>is a party to the proceeding/is an officer, director, or trustee of a party/has an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding/is likely to be a material witness in this case</i>}. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(f). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Related to party &amp; officers,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.9, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(I) {<i>name</i>}, who is {<i>related to the judge within the third degree/related to the judge’s spouse within the third degree/the spouse of a person related to the judge within the third degree/the spouse of a person related to the judge’s spouse within the third degree</i>}, is {<i>a party to the proceeding/an officer, director, or trustee of a party/known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding/likely to be a material witness in this case</i>}. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(f). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Related to party &amp; officers,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.9, p. 110.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(J) {<i>name</i>}, {<i>the judge/the judge’s spouse/a person related to the judge within the first degree/a person related to the judge’s spouse within the first degree/the spouse of a person related to the judge within the first degree/the spouse of a person related to the judge’s spouse within the first degree</i>}, is acting as an attorney in this proceeding. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(g); <i>see also</i> Tex. Gov’t Code §82.066 (prohibits an attorney from appearing before judge in civil case if the attorney is related to judge within first degree). {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Acting as lawyer,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.10, p. 111.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c7">(K) {<i>name</i>}, who is acting as an attorney in this proceeding, represents the judge in another proceeding. When an attorney is representing the judge in another proceeding, it is a prima facie basis for recusal. <i>Lueg v. Lueg</i>, 976 S.W.2d 308, 311 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied); <i>see</i> Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(a). To be entitled to recusal, {<i>party</i>} must show the attorney-client relationship causes the judge’s impartiality in the case to be questioned. <i>Lueg</i>, 976 S.W.2d at 311. {<i>Show the attorney’s representation of the judge affects the judge financially, personally, or politically in some important way. See factors set out in Lueg, 976 S.W.2d at 311.</i>} {<i>See O’Connor’s Texas Appeals, “Judge represented by lawyer,” ch. 13-J, §4.1.1(1), p. 109.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c5">7. {<i>State specific facts that show the judge should be recused under Rule 18b(2) or other authority.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">D. Notice to Other Parties</p>

  <p class="western c5">8. A copy of this motion is served on the other parties on the same day this motion is filed. {<i>Party</i>} expects this motion to be presented to Judge {<i>name</i>} three days after it is filed, unless Judge {<i>name</i>} orders otherwise. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(b). {<i>See</i> <i class="c4">O’Connor’s Texas Rules</i><i>, “Notice to other parties,” ch. 5-C, §4.2, p. 250.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">E. Conclusion</p>

  <p class="western c5">9. {<i>Briefly summarize the motion.</i>}</p>

  <p class="western c6">F. Prayer</p>

  <p class="western c5">10. For these reasons, {<i>party</i>} asks the judge of the court either to recuse {<i>himself/herself</i>} and request that the presiding judge of this administrative judicial district assign another judge to this case, or in the alternative, to refer this motion to the presiding judge of this administrative district for a hearing on this motion.</p>
